Review based on customer point of view.",,
20,60," A driver has damaged my car, but unfortunately DLS does not give home. I called this company and indicated exactly from which truck something fell off my car. It can happen that something jumps up from the asphalt, but that would not have happened in that case. I was driving next to the truck and not behind it. An elongated object (a kind of dry-tractor) falls from the truck onto my car, resulting in a dent. The only way to hold this company accountable is with the help of a dashcam.

86,257,"Not only did the delivery driver showed up unannounced at our house without a call beforehand to arrange an appointment (as was clearly indicated in the email we received from bol.com), he was also absolutely unfriendly and unprofessional.
My wife couldn't open the door the first time he rang because she was in the middle of breastfeeding. So the driver called me (to my surprise since, again, this was completely unannounced), and I let him know that my wife was home (though I didn't know she was unable to open).
He then unloaded the palette and rolled it to our door, rang again, and was about to just leave it there when my wife was finally able to open the door. She tried to explain the situation but he was just absolutely unfriendly to her.
Absolutely unprofessional.",,
87,258," Very dissatisfied.
If something is good, I like to put it on a review.
If something is bad, unfortunately also.
An estimated delivery time would appear on the website after 9am on the day of delivery.
Didn't happen.
After an hour of waiting, I tried to contact them by phone.
That turned out to be absolutely impossible.
Then I sought contact online: also an unworkable channel.
Dozens of phone calls later (finally around noon) I got in by phone. An employee there said that delivery would be made between 2 pm and 4 pm.
Less than fifteen minutes later it turned out that the transport had been postponed due to no driver available.
This cost me my entire last available vacation day of the year that I had left (and lost > €900 in consultancy income...).
Communication: 0.0.
Accessibility: 0.0.
Customer service: 0.0.
Once, but never again...

",,
88,259," I agree with the other positive reviews about a Betersport delivery. I was very afraid that we would have to carry the crosstrainer up ourselves (we were already prepared for it), but the driver asked me if he should help me and helped me to take it up a narrow stairwell to the 3rd floor. Thank you very much and a compliment to this driver from Allroad! However, it seems like a lottery whether you get a helpful driver or not, so hope Allroad recognize the drivers who do help you too!

",,
89,260," Super transport company. Had a very nice driver who helped me to put my heavy recovery shipment as far as possible in the final place. With a lot of respect and decency he helped me and came up with ideas to really put the package as close to the spot as possible. Please hire more such drivers so that more customers are served properly.

",,
90,261," Today the treadmill was delivered from Betersport. What a whopper and 78 kilos!
I stood there alone ...
I had a super delivery from Allroad. Together with my neighbor, he brought the colossus upstairs. Our front doors can only be reached via a stone staircase on the road and the delivery person could of course not just put it on the public road .....
I am very happy :-)

",,
91,262," The worst transport company ever seen!!! Their delivery time is not correct at all. Do not communicate that they are not coming. Give a 2nd date which is also incorrect. When will the delivery come....... I could cancel my delivery because the product was no longer good to use. Do you see on the front edge that your delivery is done by them... cancel it already... you will be bezeiked right in front of you.

",,
92,263," BAD !! Ordered a spinning bike (40kg) has to lift that thing to 1 high on my own. Which is not possible. Called customer service but they indicated it's in the fine print of the terms and conditions really feel misguided. Have ordered heavier products before and these were always neatly lifted up by the deliverers. Bad action by the Albert Heijn to link itself to a bad delivery service.

",,
93,264," Largest *** company in existence. Delivery had to be delivered at home as this incompetent company does not cooperate with delivery points. After my package from the supplier ended up in their depot in Eindhoven via Allroad Logistics about 30 km from my hometown (across the border), they found it interesting to send my parcel to Melle (East Flanders and 150 km further) so that it can then be delivered to Belgium. could be delivered. In addition, there will be no communication to you (would have preferred to pick it up in Eindhoven yourself), if you already call you will be lied to that someone has stopped by and left a note in the letterbox, which was not the case. now I have been able to wait 2 days at home for a ***** service to be lied to by phone. Very sad company this.

",,
94,265," Great service. Today, as agreed, my spinning bike was delivered. Very nice driver who helped me to get this heavy package up and inside the stairs. I am very satisfied with the service of Allroad logistics. Also easily accessible by phone to make an appointment.

",,
95,266," What a worthless company!
Delivery driver will deliver a crosstrainer of 51 kg. I live 5 high with an elevator. My son was at home and asks: can you bring it up? No, is the answer. But it is a heavy package. That's not my problem was the answer.
My son down. Is that man standing there with the package on a sack truck. Asked again if he would like to bring it up because it is impossible to lift / slide that heavy thing on your uppie. No, he doesn't start there. He slides it off his cart and sort it out.
What a rude company.
Called and the company thinks it's normal.
What horks!

",,
96,267," Allroad logistics puts a 74 KG box, containing a brand new cross trainer, in front of the front door and refuses to bring the box in. According to the driver / delivery person, they should never be allowed to enter ?! In response to my complaint: ""To prevent damage in the house, all orders are delivered at the door""
A package of 74 kg on the sidewalk?
BAD SERVICE!

",,
97,268," Wow what a BAD service. They send an email with track & trace that the delivery is on Wednesday (a very heavy cross trainer) so I arrange that I will be home on WEDNESDAY. Then I find out that they DELIVERED the order unannounced on Tuesday, with our downstairs neighbors on floor 2.
We live on floor 3. What do you think? That thing is 2 high. I myself cannot lift that thing to the 3rd floor, but do you think that those delivery people are interested? No they left that thing TASTY. Who will find out? So I took everything apart and lugged it up 20 times.

What good is an email with track & trace if they don't mess with it and why would you still order online if you are still lugging.

",,
98,269," Good experience with treadmill delivery. Driver asked for help (heavy box), after putting on his mouth mask, I went to help him. Was on time and all communication about the delivery was ok. 3 stars because I can expect from the company that they can carry out heavy deliveries themselves with two or at least use a pallet to deliver to the door.

",,
99,270," An important characteristic of a transporter must be that they are reliable. That is not this company at all. Several times appointments are not kept, so I have the people, but not the stuff. Bad company, discourage! See photo, it was not delivered that day at 8 pm, but delivered the next day at 9 am, without further consultation.

",,
100,271," Package to be delivered was placed in driveway where it was accessible to everyone. This without any consultation, luckily I came home that day when it was still light and saw it. Track and trace mail turned out to be in junk mail, so did not know that the package would be delivered.

",,
101,272," Took the day off because an order would come through Betersport.
Didn't see anyone all day.

",,
102,273," Just saw 2 of their drivers overloaded here, the packages literally flew into one car from the other and the packages that did not make it were kicked further 😱

",,
103,274," Very good service , friendly driver .
Delivered by Mert logistics is a must!

",,
104,275," Order taken well. The only problem was that I also bought a treadmill lubricating oil and it came without a lid. How can I use it ??

",,
105,276," What an incredibly rude company that you guys still exist at all. When I meet such a rude delivery boy again, he has a big problem with his big mouth and arrogant attitude

",,
106,277," What a horrible company !! Track and trace is incorrect. Sat at home all day and package did not arrive. I'll call then .. oh we'll come next week. Bahbah

I genuinely do not recommend this company in any way possible. GVT is an amazing example of a horrible workplace in Netherlands. Employees are exploited in a grand scheme. The larger warehouse is doable, but still highly unprofessional and a very hazardous ""workplace"". Employees recieve zero education and work in dirty, very poorly maintained and culture lacking workplace. There is aswell another warehouse on other side, which is pure and absolute hell. Employees driving without certifications on vehicles illegally, driving seriously dangerously, without safety belts, without any work related safety equipment, some don't even have safety shoes, don't have any prior education and often don't even speak English or dutch, are incapable of mature communication and don't have understanding of standard warehouse practices. All under supervision of a teamleader and their aprooval. GVT is a front page example of what business in Netherlands should NOT be. Bad taste in employees. Lack of any teambuilding. Complete abolition of safety ( absolute zero ). Employees driving outside at night without their lights on. Forklift full speed, forks 1.5 meters high. Serious malpractice. Please investigate this. Warehouse in Budel was closed because GVT completely abandoned any form of infrastructure inside and refresco literally tossed them out of partnership due to their irresponsibility.",,

213,498," Good logistics, your own parking near the company, you stop at the parking lot with a sign on where to go to the drivers, fill out a sheet with the data, give it to a very nice and friendly woman out the window, get papers and a map for the gate, when you approach the ramp you put papers in the trailer, loading is fast, then parking, documents, and exit. + Coffee door on the right where the dispatcher is sitting)

",,
214,499," Can only indicate that they come here regularly to pick up shipments (pallets) and that it is always done in a correct and careful manner. Since we have a good experience with Helder Transport, they call in GVT for this, keep it up!

",,
215,500," A company that says it can do anything for others,
but is not a good employer for personnel.
They assume more they can handle,
and then have to pull out all the stops.
Within the company, it is normal for drivers to be banned by planning and other employees, and if you report this, they do nothing with it.

in short, Passion for logistics?
You mean passion for big money, and this on the back of employees.

330,897,"The only people that like to smile at this place are those with dutch leadership. Internetional teams are never happy ,or bright. A lot of arrogance towards the new recruitment under International leadership. You need to use EPT-no access,you need a scanner-no profile,you need to use a knife-security steals yours and nobody provides you with one that work. You need to pick up high item,they ducktape it with his next huge box from behind and place it up for you. You ask for help - they are trying to hide from you,or make sad/angry faces and try to put you away. Not only noone says anything positive under International leadership,but also can warn you that you may have a lot of enemies on your second day of work. You need to speak to someone important ,walking is minimum 10minutes combined to and from your locker with the exiting procedures with the security also takes time and sometime you have to wait on a line.When on a break most of your time when you need your phone goes walking,or security check. Parking for workers as far as possible from the building,so you walk more and waste time more to get to and from your car. Bicycles are parked under the rain. It is very clean and good renewed place.",,

345,912," They don’t let me in before, a maximum of an hour and I had to stand behind the barrier. When loading, wait in the driver's room where there is a free shower, coffee and toilet. The staff is pleasant.

",,
346,913," At the entrance there is a parking lot for three cars; at registration you need a passport and a reference number. Downloaded in three hours. The office already has a good shower on site, coffee is paid for. Loading only from the rear, from the ramp. The staff are friendly. 👍🏻

",,
347,914," Registration at the gate ... you get a card and which building you go to ... English-speaking staff ... nice people.. fast charging ... toilet.. free coffee ... when leaving, leave the card in a specially arranged place.. .

",,
349,916," Unloading address that does not make people happy.
No dutch speaking staff, which doesn't seem motivated.

",,
350,917," Sad company long waiting times and unclear why it has to take so long.

",,
351,918," Everything is standard, at registration you need a ref number, passport, adr shoes, vest. They are not allowed to wait in the car, a separate room. Toilet, shower. Friendly staff.

",,
352,919," Employees are irresponsible, irrelevant and drivers who come there are kept waiting for hours even for registration without any reason, it doesn't suit a company, I don't like it

",,
353,920," A very good place when it comes to work, positive, helpful people ..

",,
354,921," It is almost better to apply for benefits at the municipality than to work for ID logistics. Hunger wage of 9.17 euros per hour, for them you are nothing more than a wage slave who has to work very hard to be scheduled every week. The fact that they occasionally treat people to warm apple flaps is not to keep the herd in check. My mate has a family and they only schedule him for one day. What should he do with 80 euros a week, that's not even the groceries. Now works as an operator at Coca Cola and almost gets double.

They help people in the destruction. Nobody wants to work there anymore, only the robots / Poles without a future.

",,
355,922," Loaded in principle quickly. But before entering, you must have a reference download number. Coffee for 0.20 cents in vending machines but you only need to pay by card does not accept cash :(

",,
356,923," Special company. You have to wait for hours to unload a few pallets. This is no longer necessary in this time. Such firms charge a lot of waiting hours among other things. Organically, something is not going well there. (I wrote this with 1 star in 2018)

I now give 2 stars more. Lately, every now and then a few pallets arrive, neat in the block time, and that goes pretty smoothly. 'Thumbs' up'

",,
357,924," There is no rush, they have some quiet notifications, 13 pallets and a big problem with unloading, waiting about 3 hours to unload it, coffee can be drunk to pain, in a word horror

",,
358,925," I had an advice for 3 p.m. and at 4 p.m. I was already loaded, if the forwarding meets the deadline and the time is right, everything will go smoothly. Clean and free toilets and showers for drivers. If you speak any ""Western"" language communicatively, they will talk to you differently.

",,
359,926," ID only has employees through an employment agency, you have to confirm your schedule and then you get 3 more changes in the schedule. Result you only work 2@3 days while every NORMAL person wants to work 5 or more

",,
360,927," For unloading, before entering the barrier, you need to present your passport and documents for the cargo, enter the territory, go to the office, give the documents and wait for unloading from 1-3 hours. Car under the ramp, in equipment (boots, vest) present when unloading. After, documents. Departure around the warehouse, under the barrier from the back side (almost like dropping into a company)

",,
361,928," It is not of this time that drivers with this cold just have to stand outside the all-annoying counter, everyone is warm except drivers (who are already approached and treated differently)

This concerned a batch of high-tech goods and products that had to be shipped from California to our cinema in Leidschendam. Especially in the current, very turbulent market for intercontinental shipping, Jill was able to realize that everything was available at the right time at the right place as agreed at a very competitive rate. Previously had good experiences with DR Logistics when shipping MX4D for Kinepolis Utrecht; if more MX4D rooms are added in the future, I will definitely approach Jill again to help us.

",,
432,1185," Very bad experience just had with Jasper from ChainCargo. For the first time in a year they called us for an emergency ride. We asked to call back if we can carry out the ride, given that the ride had to be done in two days. It was okay. After 15 minutes we were able to find the occupation and have called Jasper back with the message that we can carry out the ride and the driver is on his way. We are told ""That is no longer necessary, I have found another solution and was just about to call you"". Not happy with this way of working. While we are busy to be able to occupy his ride, that ride will resolve differently. We have indicated that we are not happy with this and how we could file a complaint. With a smile we were informed that it was only possible with him (Jasper himself). Clear that nothing is being done with it and have immediately indicated by telephone that they no longer want to be called by ChainCargo. That was also agreed on his part.

Was a driver at Van Den Bosch for 4 years. At that time a great company with several locations in the Netherlands. Belgium. UK . Germany. Even Erp was still in full size, not like it is now. Had great colleagues, dispatchers! I learned a lot and traveled all over Europe! It was a great time. But it's been 13 years!

",,
589,1579," Good morning

Our experience with Van den Bosch transport

In our eyes it has always been a renowned transport company.
However, they employ a driver who caused damage to our car. Which he does not take responsibility for.
And the company also simply says we cannot do anything with this.
In other words we just say we don't know about it. And don't do anything with it. Have a nice day.

",,
590,1580," A whole line of traffic that drives 60 where you can drive 80, as far as I can see in my mirror, from the N348 exit to the Hessenpoort near Zwolle. What is ahead? A truck from van den bosch transport. No good advertising.

591,1581," So back on the news with hungarian drivers ... will there ever be positive news about this company?

Second, after whole day of waiting, they lost one of my order.i have to call them to check what's going on. Then next day they scheduled new eta for lost item. Which makes me wasted another day on waiting.

During delivery they refuse to take away my old appliances, said they only take it if I book installation services. Which is not true according to mediamrkt policy.

I waited over 5 hours until 17:30 and still never received the plants or any kind of update by email or phone. I called them and they advised it would be approx. 45 min to an hour later. Despite this, the plants weren't actually delivered until 2 hours later at 19:30. So I waited 6.5 hours with no updates from the company except when I contacted them. I actually had to cancel dinner plans as a result. In addition I paid an additional 19.95 for special delivery to my apartment including placement and removal of trash, but instead the driver only brought the box into the lobby and I was left to deal with getting it to my apartment, set up and removing the trash.",,

",,
669,1775," Scandalous. Even this single star is too much for such an amateurish company. What should a mega company like Mediamarkt do with such amateurs? Washing machines would be provided. I took time off and waited for this delivery. They did not ring the bell at our house but called my wife who was at work and could not answer. After this we get the answer yes, we have called your telephone number and you did not answer. If you deliver to a home, you should ring the bell at that address. Unbelievably bad service, what an amateurs!

",,
670,1776," The delivery guys were at my address at the agreed time to pick up the defective refrigerator and take it away. They also called my daughter's phone number beforehand to make sure that I and my daughter were home when they came by to take the fridge with them. I think that's very good service. The delivery drivers were also friendly.

",,
671,1777," Terrible people! They throw a letter in the mailbox that we were not at home while they did not even ring the bell!!! We have been waiting for a washing machine and dryer for 2 weeks and something always goes wrong. I'm all set. And then they indicate by telephone: yes you have been called 3 times you did not answer? you shouldn't call me. You should ring the doorbell.

Has been moved a few times with 10 minutes but worked perfectly.
Driver called 10 min before arrival (20 or 30 minutes would be nicer)

Old fridge taken, neat service! Thank you gentlemen.

673,1779," The delivery man Jan came to pick up my defective refrigerator. He had to carry the colossal thing on his own, yet he was in a good mood and a sense of humour. I think that the customer is kept informed by email is a very nice/good service.

674,1780," Great service. Just 5 minutes in advance a phone call that he was coming. American fridge would be brought up to the threshold of our house according to the conditions.

",,
676,1782," What a terribly bad company. 0 stars for this company. Ordered a washing machine from the media market and paid for everything including lifting and installation and what happens here. They put him at the front door and drive away….. really not normal!!! You pay for installation and lifting and you get pretty nothing. Flut company do not do business with.

",,
677,1783," Super friendly and helpful man.
He not only brought our fridge but also a dose of positivity and a bit of humor.
In the few minutes that the delivery took, Mr. was already so cozy that you almost wanted to invite him for a barbeque. More people like this and the world was a nicer place!

",,
678,1784," Relaxed driver. It is a pity that he did not know that there was also something to return, but that is more due to the lack of the option on the website. So there could still be room for improvement. But the driver didn't want to make that my problem and took the old dishwasher with him. Would like to contact his boss ;-)

Unfortunately you will really have to buy something to get something of the quality of the delivery service and Rachid. Unfortunately, I have to advise against buying that at Mediamarkt. That won't make you happy.

687,1793," Nice delivery service. They had some delay, it was almost unnoticeable. They called ahead of time that they were coming. They neatly placed in the kitchen and then left. Nice people.

690,1796," After a bad experience with a delivery person who did not work neatly at all and was demolishing with my cooling, a top person came today to deliver a 2nd cooling and very neatly put the cooling in its place and treated my things very neatly and carefully.

Very thoughtful. Due to a mistake by the media market, not everything went as agreed, but he couldn't do anything about that.
Cheerful polite man.

",,
708,1814," What a drama.
Bought a refrigerator at Media Markt with next day delivery as a condition. I planned everything neatly, immediately removed the old refrigerator, leveled the floor, installed water, etc.

After a double check with media market, I ordered groceries for the next day, but the fridge did not come. So I was able to throw half of the groceries in the container.

After that, First Logistics cannot be reached, the telephone number is not answered, not even during opening hours. I must have called 10 times.

Media Markt says it cannot do anything if First Logistics is not available.

Next day delivery now takes 3 days, I can't get in touch and there is no date yet. I am now without a fridge and have had to throw away a good part of my groceries and my family logistics are now quite problematic. The slogan ""Receiving a new product should be a party"" has become a downer.

",,
709,1815," The delivery person was friendly, helpful and in for a small chat. great service.

",,
710,1816," First Logistics would deliver a washing machine from Mediamarkt. It turned out that a part was missing that could not be delivered, according to the delivery person. The delivery person would take the washing machine back and promised that Mediamarkt would contact them for delivery of a replacement washing machine. Lies, lies, lies. MediaMarkt now refuses to supply a new washing machine or to compensate for the price difference (because it has become more expensive in the meantime). And the joke is that I could have ordered the part myself for a few euros elsewhere and if I ordered the same washing machine again I would have lost more than a hundred euros extra.

",,
711,1817," There is absolutely nothing wrong with the staff, but that they have to do everything alone is a bit heavy. I wouldn't take the time slot too seriously

",,
712,1818," Very good service! Delivery people were very helpful and friendly.

716,1822," These two toppers were super friendly and helped out excellently with cleaning and disconnecting the washing machine. These two toppers deserve to get a nice bonus!

Suddenly get an email that he or she stopped by at 17:12. Me and my girlfriend were both home, but I can tell you that no one rang the bell! Nice chance, but I'm not surprised when I look at the reviews of others here.

I also do not understand that the media market continues to work with such a low rating!

So today our new American fridge was delivered, we received an email between what time we could expect them and that was right.

Neatly inspected, placed and connected by Kevin and Levi, without damage or misery, the refrigerator in and the old American refrigerator out.
Not easy with these heavy, large beasts, but top notch!
And all the packaging material again neatly taken.
Happy with these men and with our new refrigerator.

Kevin and Levi, nice guys who do their job well with a smile and a love. Our compliments to you both!

764,1870," Extremely bad service. Last week I bought a washing machine from Mediamarkt and it was supposed to be delivered last Friday with Firstlogistics but that doesn't ever happen. I did receive an email with the delivery time to I was waiting for nothing. I called Mediamarkt and they indicated that no appointment is scheduled for delivery. Super weird but I made a new appointment for today and received a new email yesterday with the time. Nothing was delivered today. Both times I had to wait for nothing. Both times had to arrange with my work that I am absent as I do not work at home. I am mediamarkt they have no idea what is going on I call firstlogistics and the line is busy all day. Really worst service ever...

",,
765,1871," They have very bad appointments. They make you wait at home for nothing with a time window of 11:10 and 14:10.

The Track and Trace also doesn't work for this company, it just stands there for show to pretend to be professional.

After I called First Logistics at 3:16 pm today I was told by the operator that her screen says ""ringed the bell and not at home"".
This was just an excuse from Albert, the delivery I would receive according to mail.
I was just at home!

I urged them to still have the washing machine delivered, but they want to move this to Tuesday.
I was just at home!!!!
They let those delivery guys continue working with impunity.
This Albert did not want to perform this time-consuming job, and used this as an excuse!!!!

Albert!!!! Very cowardly of you!!!

I'm going to mention your name tomorrow at Media Markt.

Unfortunately I don't have a leg to stand on against this company, because they have to deal with crowds.

They also send confirmations that are incorrect, they report it as if the customer has made changes.

I advise anyone who has a household appliance delivered by Media Markt to arrange a carrier themselves.

I will still raise this with Mediamarkt Dordrecht.

Tomorrow I'm going to complain about Albert the delivery man/impostor at Media Markt Dordrecht.

Again, I was home!!!!!!

",,
766,1872," TV would come on July 12 between 1 and 5. Nothing in around 5 am I call yes within half an hour the delivery person has to come he is on his way. After half an hour I call again he can be there any moment. After 5min I check track and trace again and it appears that it is now July 14th. According to the customer service of first Logistics, how can a delivery person who has to be at the door every moment like this suddenly leave and deliver two days later. Now that I read the review here from people I am afraid that it will not arrive after 2 days. I will never order from a site where they work with first Logistics again. Never experienced anything like this!!!!

",,
767,1873," Ordered a refrigerator from Mediamarkt last Sunday 30-5. First the slight disappointment that it could not be delivered the next day (which they do advertise) but good can happen in these times. Receive a neat email stating that the refrigerator will be delivered on Friday 4 June and that the time lock would follow. Thursday night follow 2!? e-mails in quick succession with 2 x a time slot (16:55 - 19:55 and 17:25 - 20:25) in which the refrigerator will be delivered. The next day nothing more from First Logistics, not by update mail, unreachable by phone and no response to mail. In short, very unprofessional and disappointing as I spent 3 hours in an empty house waiting for a fridge for nothing. We can better spend this time like this, at the very least First Logistics could have indicated what where and when.... heard nothing and absolutely nothing. Mediamarkt was supposed to call me back, but I think they will contact me tonight because it is also very quiet here. Wondering if we'll hear something tomorrow and when the fridge will be delivered..

",,
768,1874," The collaboration between first logics and the media market is a disaster. Media Markt advertises the next day delivery. Employees just don't tell you that if FL comes to install it, it can only be done as soon as a spot is available. So if this is a week you wait a week for your order.
FL and the media market really need to find a better way in their communication to customers.

So I've been waiting for a week now for a TV I bought and hopefully it will finally be hung on Monday. I pay €80 for that. €80 wait and be patient money!!!

",,
769,1875," Delivery guys were very nice, well explained toppers

770,1876," These deliver on behalf of the Mediamarkt. We had paid for the installation and placement of the dryer with an intermediate piece. Was simply refused: ""no sir, then the warranty will expire.""

",,
771,1877," Washing machine ordered from MediaMarkt, was delivered by First Logistics. Was kept well informed by email and neatly called fifteen minutes in advance that they would be coming. The old washing machine was also neatly taken away. A tip is not to have one person delivered with heavy items, but two.

772,1878," I am at peace with the deliverers!

778,1884," Always exciting when you order plants online whether they also arrive beautiful and intact, but you don't have to worry about this via this company. They arrive well packed and safe. Absolutely great!

779,1885," Good fast delivery nice delivery guys highly recommended.

",,
780,1886," In the e-mail it is mentioned several times that deliveries are made to the 4th floor. Not so! The deliverers are willing or able to deliver literally right down to the first doorstep. I live in an upstairs apartment and my washing machine was literally dumped in front of my small stairway and a photo was happily taken of it blocking my stairs and front door as proof that it had been ""delivered""!

",,
781,1887," less good service! (eventually well)
My purchased package from MediaMarkt would first be delivered on 27-05-2021. A few hours before delivery, I receive an email that the package will suddenly be delivered the next day (28-05-2021).
They did NOT come by again on 28-05-2021. No email this time.
Today 29-05-2021 I received an email that the package will only be delivered 03-06-2021. This is sad! I have contacted mediamarkt and they will file an official complaint if the package is not delivered before 31-05.

Finally the package was delivered after 3 days.

",,
782,1888," Waiting over a month and still no delivery. After all, the appointment has been changed 8 times (due to their blunders) and the only response you get (if someone picks up at all) is 'I can't help it'. I truly have never experienced such a bad company in my life. All thanks to Media Markt who is collaborating with this.

",,
783,1889," The two gentlemen were very helpful, careful and although this is a part-time job for them, they worked very professionally. Called in advance saying they would be there in 20 minutes. They were very neat and polite. I am very satisfied with the delivery of my washing machine.

Called immediately and it would be delivered and installed at 12.30. Didn't come next day. After calling around 13.15 you get all kinds of excuses. Mechanic wasn't there until his appointment of 11 a.m

Called Mediamarkt and everything cancelled. worthless company

",,
787,1893," Bought a tumble dryer for my mother at the Mediamarkt, including a drain connection and intermediate drawer to have it placed above the existing washing machine (bathroom). For this we paid the option full service installation of more than 50 Euro! at the Mediamarkt.

However, the dryer is only put down (packaging is still attached) and then everything is left behind. A story is sold that the dryer itself has a collection tray and therefore a drain hose is not necessary. Placing the dryer above the existing washing machine is also not necessary. My mother is unfortunately not technical and not assertive. The result was that we have to make a new appointment for the complete installation!

The possible (conceivable) reason could be that these technicians have to work under time pressure. The daily schedule is probably not feasible. Or do they not feel like working on that day. Almost weekend! We will never find out.

788,1894," Helpful and fast delivery people. Top job done

789,1895," Nice and friendly man. Very tidy and explained everything well.

",,
790,1896," Incredibly unprofessional. The delivery man came to see me today and knocked the door softly a few times. And then he just ran off to the car and pulled up really hard. The car rocked a lot. Last time I had to send the fridge back because of dents. I now fully understood why this is so. If they drive like this, then they have no chance at all to deliver products without damage. I also have a doorbell on the door. He deliberately didn't use it. They just weren't here to deliver my product. They just wanted to leave as soon as possible. The phone number of this company is also not reachable at all. I think they're closing lines. SCANDALOUS. BAD. WORTHLESS.

",,
791,1897," Changed my review, unfortunately it could not be solved the same day. But the lady on the phone was helpful and tried to think along. After I explained my situation clearly! Fortunately, it was still well delivered after 4 delivery attempts!

793,1899," Concerns purchase of American refrigerator including connection service via Mediamarkt and disposal of packaging material and old American refrigerator.

After reading the many bad reviews about FL, I became a bit hesitant. Didn't seem necessary! The 2 nice, attentive and professional Amsterdam brothers from FL were perfectly on time, even called me fifteen minutes in advance. Disposal of old and installation of new refrigerator went smoothly. Even got some tips! Nothing but praise for these guys!

794,1900," Reaching someone after a lot of effort After the contact very service-oriented, thoughtful and delivered as agreed.

Immediately this morning at 8.30 am I had an email with the time slot, great! Deliverers were on time, very friendly (good taste in music too) and delivered the washing machine to the top of the drip tray, which I was very happy with, because those things are enormously heavy (the machines - not the drip tray, I can still do that) lifting).

806,1912," I had reserved and paid for an extensive installation explanation, but nothing came of it. I found it out myself with the help of the user manual, but I do not find it acceptable to pay € 59.95 extra for this.

Day of delivery according to appointment with the Media Market no one seen, after not having been lied to 34x finally trying to get someone on the line, we are told that it will come the next day! Can't give time, an email comes after 8pm
Receive mail with time slot for the next day from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm, no one shows up. Unreachable on the phone

Called media market and canceled
Helpdesk of the media market does nothing to blame Firstlogistics for this

",,

I received a nice email the day before that you will be informed about the delivery, but nothing is further from the truth, also called several times but no reply. Even the media market customer service doesn't know where the package is! It is a great pity that First Logistics is the reason that I no longer order anything big from the media market.

But they have done damage to my door frame and are not handling the damage as promised, no response at all from their side as promised. Contact sought several times, but no solution from First Logistics.

My appointment would take place between 3.30 and 6.30 p.m. All of a sudden I get a call at 13.15 that they will be there in an hour, I will ask at work if I can leave earlier as this was not planned and will hurry home. When I come home there is no one around, no one comes all day. Media market should distance itself from you, because it also gives them a bad name.

841,1947," What a dramatic service !!! Are unreachable by phone. We had placed an order with the MediaMarkt, but they themselves are not satisfied with their service and cannot reach First Logistics themselves either.

Never order anything from Media Markt again as long as they outsource the transport there!

Expected time was nowhere to be found between 14:00 and 17:00. After that I didn't get a new date and time and media market can't tell me when this will happen. First Logistics telephone number is apparently not in use either. Money back is only possible after an investigation has been completed. Good advertisement for your Mediamarkt and First Logistics!

847,1953," Period 15:00 -> 18:00 has been specified. The delivery person would call before the delivery was delivered. Went home earlier from work, but unfortunately nothing. No delivery person seen and no phone call. Emailed, and told that I was not at home. The next delivery was then made 1.5 weeks fresher. No flexibility at all from this company.

Then they would have delivered it to the neighbor without my permission. And all of a sudden they don't respond to emails! update : driver comes here after closing. 3 weeks later a package comes back via nl logistics... the driver does not deliver back on the agreed day. The company does not let us know while we are just waiting... when we inquired, the driver allegedly had a breakdown. 2x in 1 month misery with this courier service.

1017,2357," I bought a bicycle at 't Fietshokje and it was delivered by means of NL Logistics. The entire process was not smooth with the communication between me and 't Fietshokje. Unfortunately, it was also not nice with NL Logistics. I got one of their deliverers on the line at 't Fietshokje and he couldn't even tell me what the latest times are that they deliver to their home.
Then he put me through with a number. Here they could tell me this and they also indicated that my bike would arrive around 3 o'clock on Wednesday. Then I am waiting until 6 am and no bike yet. Now on Thursday at half past one a delivery person arrives with ""I was almost gone"", while I walked down two flights of stairs immediately after the bell. I find it strange that he hardly waits. Then I mention that according to them the bicycle would already be delivered yesterday. To this he replied ""We do not promise anything"", while it was clearly said on the phone that the bike would be delivered around 3 o'clock.

The same problem here as what I experienced with 't Fietshokje. Please do not say that you deliver a product for a certain time / day and then it does not arrive. At the very least, you can contact me to say it will be delayed or something, because then I don't have to sit at home all day waiting for a delivery.

1077,2506,"I work with TCI since a view years since a supplier send us a shipment DDU from oversea over Rotterdam to Germany. Their carrier chose TCI randomly for the import and delivery.

Before and unfortunately also afterwards we recieved shipments by several carriers. Including some of the big players like Hapag-Lloyd. Sometimes  we had delays that caused demurrage fees for us. Sometimes they was unreachable (just a ticket system) or we had to find our own customs agent for the import declaration. Sometimes they tried to save some money by putting the container on a barge up the Rhine, which then caused delays of 2 weeks.
None of this has ever happened at TCI!

For each container I get a fix contact person (they all do a great job) who can help me about anything.

Last Shipment from yesteday (Import container from China):
I send them the documents 2 weeks before ship arrival at Rotterdam.
In the week before my contact person planed the delivery timing, before the ship has even arrived (Planed was Monday between 14 and 15 o'clock).
Ship arrived in the harbour on Saturday, 1. May (Holiday).
Arrival of the container at our place in Germany: Monday, 03. May, 15:09.

1108,2550," Unfortunately very dubious. Everything went smoothly for me until the delivery. Then the goods arrived without agreeing on a delivery date. I can't say whether that was intentional, but I wouldn't be surprised. The goods were accepted by a neighbor and unloaded on my property. Unfortunately, my neighbors did not notice and document the transport damage. A few hours later I discovered the goods in my yard and noticed the damage, which was obviously caused by the load securing. I immediately documented and reported the damage. The lashing straps that damaged the goods were still attached. After several emails, I was informed several times that no damage was noted on the delivery note and that they are checking what can be done. After that, no reaction. Only when asked again and again the same answer. After pointing out the legal situation, there was no answer at all. I find it cheeky how customers are treated here, especially when I think about how much this ""service"" cost me.

I get a quote again and have to pay € 235 for the same package of 730 kg. I get in touch by phone and the only answer I get is: put it on mail and we will check it. I had already put it on email and I get a more expensive quote. So I don't think so!

1. Telephone information has promised to send an offer within the remaining auction time of 3 hours. The offer comes a day later = no reliability

2. The price offered appears to me like an offer to reject. Comparable prices of other forwarding agents is one third of the offer. Transport of 20ft containers over 400km, loading and unloading by forklift € 2,185.00. = outrageous prices

After having just contacted your colleague by phone, please:

Is it normal that the Witlox staff try to park in your trunk on the A15 during slow traffic from Pernis towards Barendrecht and if this does not work, they push on your bumper with a lot of hand gestures? I realize that my Audi looks very big ... BUT believe me when I tell you ... Witlox Transport car 06 is really not going to fit!

You might think why do this ... because 2x telephone contact with your colleague was so associative from your side and after your colleague angrily told him that he was done with it, I just cut off the conversation as I don't like to eat rotten fish to be decided ...

Perhaps it is about time to talk to the staff about customer service because I can imagine that if you speak to people over the phone, your customer base will quickly decrease.

I would like to quickly report that this happened on June 18 at about 16.10 and 16.20 during slow-moving and stationary traffic with matrix signs at 50 km / h. Your driver can push through what he wants, but I would have had to crawl into the trunk of my predecessor and let that Audi be just too big for that!

1163,2665,"Nicely packed by Hornbach & delivered pleasantly by the delivery person in the morning to the 1st floor (it was not very heavy).

I see a lot of negative reviews and thought I'd chime in with a positive review. I have ordered from other companies and if it is heavy, it is generally not possible for the delivery person to lift it to a higher floor. Last week I had 700kg floorplates on the pavement as the delivery persons forklift could not reach the floor safely (from another delivery company). They even told me ""Not to shoot the messenger"" as it is not their responsibility as they only deliver & are not handymen. I think in general if you make an order weighing more than 30kg, it's wise to arrange someone to help you pick up that weight to avoid injury.

In my case, the driver was very nice & wished me well for the renovations. Thanks!",,

This is a public street and not my property. I asked the driver if he could at least move the pallet inside onto the terrace for it to be on my property, and he refused. His suggestion was that the guy who installs the tiles can move them.....which would be 3 weeks from now. The driver then left. Thanks for nothing!

I asked the delivery man if he could bring it upstairs because I cannot do it by myself. I know so far from my partner that this was arranged because I am home alone and I couldn’t do it by myself. This man (if I can call it man) was extremely rude to me. Shouting, yelling, I even got scared if he could do something to me. He was completely out of him, saying that I can stay crying if I want but then he won’t deliver the package. This man is like a beast. I want a solution and huge apologies for this moment that just made me to stress so much that as I said I expect a reaction from your side.

Have had a good conversation with the company. Will be arrested in 4 weeks. Result follows.

What a ### company!! Break everything, copy your signature (forgery) and don't think along from customer service. You pay big money for this. Driver breaks pallet with brute force. Good luck with driving a 200kg in your garden. Gets in his car and drives away without saying a word. My solution was to stack the pallet together and place it 1 meter inside my gate. No, they don't. And I was allowed to help with unloading myself because the driver couldn't. See photos of the tiles. And yes I will take this further as promised.

1179,2681," Hornbach air conditioning ordered and I am happy to pay 44 euros delivery costs so that I do not have to lift with the device (40 kilos). Receive an email to schedule an appointment that doesn't work (No information about your order was found.). In the night I get a text message that they will deliver today between 12:45 and 15:15, if I am not there extra costs will be charged (bit strange). Delivery arrives on time, rings the bell and I walk downstairs to check if necessary. to assist. Sir walks away to which I ask can you help? No, no elevator but it's not that heavy and sir continues. Van Spreuvel Transport if you need transport just that little bit better......

1180,2682," Received my kamado large on time today. Friendly delivery person, but unfortunately orders are delivered to the door. I had ordered the kamado because of duet weight and with the hope that it would at least be delivered over the threshold, also because delivery costs were added.. but unfortunately not the case, maybe missed the small print? Too bad, because there I was..

1181,2683," The first time I write a review about a transport company, but get into my pen because I am so positive about the delivery.
The communication went great. The day before I received an email and the day itself, 15 minutes before delivery I was called.
The driver was very friendly, pleasant to deal with and helpful!
Everything was delivered neatly and undamaged.

Very much looking forward to next time!!!

order number 2466279

",,
1182,2684," Today, Hornbach concrete ply sheets ordered by this company were delivered. Instead of flat delivery, in a Danish cart, which means that the plates already arrive crooked and curved. Not a single plate undamaged. Worthless how they handle customer stuff

",,
1183,2685," Lousy service, delivery literally put down. No cooperation or assistance whatsoever. Ordered several items and after helping himself and bringing some in, the transporter was simply unresponsive when he returned downstairs. Horribly bad transport company! Nicely done as Hornbach being employed with such a transport company.

",,
1184,2686," Received a message this week that I could choose my delivery day. Chosen for Thursday, then no time received so I just called. Turns out they decided to make the delivery a day later without letting us know. They threaten with costs if you are not at home, but if you take a day off to be home, they will not come themselves.

1185,2687," The delivery went great! Very friendly lady who was very helpful. Received a nice text and e-mail the night before what time they were there the next day and you could follow in the morning how many stops there were for delivery. Really great! Have experienced other companies that were absolutely not helpful and/or friendly. Recommended!

",,
1186,2688," Transport went well, planning called the day before delivery, called by driver 15 minutes before delivery.
Everything neatly arranged and on time.
Taken to the door with the forklift.
And in all fairness, I don't expect the driver to lug it in too.
Driver was very polite and helpful.

",,
1187,2689," This is by far the worst transport company out there. 4 pallets not delivered for 3 days, (overlooked) 4 large pallets! Not on time delivery, vague answers, very poor communication, and I could go on and on. Really not a good word for about!

",,
1188,2690," Very reliable carrier. Delivers quickly and always at agreed times. Drivers are very sympathetic and helpful. One phone call and they organize the logistics the way you want.
Very reliable transport company.

",,
1189,2691," A delivery of the complete sanitary facilities, an indication time by email in advance, neatly called 15 minutes in advance that they will be there in no time. It was neatly packed, delivered by a friendly driver unfortunately forgot his name.

",,
1190,2692," Do you want something delivered but are you hesitant about the transport? Then Van Spreuwel Transport from Eindhoven is an excellent choice.
First of all you will be kept well informed of the process. For example, we received an order from Hornbach via van Spreuwel Transport. First we were called by a nice lady if delivery would come out at a certain time. This was neatly confirmed in the mail. Half an hour before the delivery, the driver contacted us by phone. That he was en route and would arrive in half an hour. In that telephone conversation it was agreed that if he stood at the driveway he would call again. No point. Neatly on time the driver arrived at the driveway. I was able to show him the way. The truck was skillfully maneuvered at the relevant building. . The load was neatly lashed and sealed in the truck. The chance of missing is therefore zero. The driver introduced himself nicely and asked where and in which order I wanted the load. Ten minutes later everything was in place!
In summary: If you want something delivered, then take Van Spreuwel Transport in your arms.

",,
1191,2693," Had delivery, customer service called nicely a day in advance. The driver also called me 15 minutes in advance, while I could also keep track of the delivery via the track and trace system. Then also had a very nice delivery person called Samir at the door, was very friendly and polite.

",,
1192,2694," I am very surprised at some of the negative reviews. At our company, we have been supplied by Van Spreuwel about 40 times a year for a very long time and we are absolutely very satisfied in all respects. Always neat and friendly drivers who also deliver on time and without damage. Many logistics companies can learn a lot from this. Chapeau Spreuwel, we are happy to have you.

",,
1193,2695," Hornbach of course does not deliver themselves, so they use an external transport company. And like others, I read all the negative comments that made me quite shocked. 1 day in advance I was called that they would deliver the next day, I would receive an email about this. Indeed around 19:02 I received a text message with the time (between 06:00 and 09:52)
Wednesday around 08:02 am it was already there with 7 pallets. Very friendly driver with his forklift, offered him another coffee but he thanked me kindly. And placed all pallets neatly in front of the door. Also indicated that the packing slips were in it and with the statement if there is any damage that I can report it within 48 hours. Had minor damage to the plasterboard, but what does a plasterboard cost 🤣

",,
1194,2696," Placed an order through a sanitary store and paid extra between 07:00 - 12:00. I received an email last night that it would be delivered between 11:00 and 15:00. Immediately sent an email that after 12:00 it would be too late for me..

Van Spreuwel Transport picked up immediately in the morning. The driver called 30 minutes in advance and was on time. And apparently there was a mistake in the planning last night. But they have done everything they can to deliver my order earlier and therefore before 12:00.

Of which tribute! Van Spreuwel Transport really thought along well with me!
And no, I don't have any shares in Van Spreuwel Transport :)

",,
1195,2697," Really don't understand those bad reviews here, so was very nervous think before writing a review. Drivers are also people who, just like you, want to be treated with respect. Don't give them a cowardly kick, on the internet.!! MY EXPERIENCE IS: I became
called the night before for an appointment, got an email with the
expected delivery time. The day of the appointment there was a neat, friendly man at the door to discuss. TOP GREAT, EVERYTHING TO WISH.
A smile does a lot of good!

",,
1196,2698," After reading the reviews I didn't have the best expectations for the delivery. Contacted planning on the day of delivery to provide the correct address (need to have a B after the house number). Very friendly and they also indicated that unfortunately they could not follow the driver, so they could not tell how long it would take before he would be there.
Neatly within the agreed time, the driver came and indicated that it was bad that day (own truck defective, bad weather) and that he was therefore behind. Despite that, he took the time to unload the goods neatly and hand everything over to us neatly.

",,
1197,2699," Bad service.
At 7:30 the driver was at the door with a pallet with bells and whistles.
He only wanted to take the pallet to the 8th floor if I would blow it....

",,
1198,2700," What a scammer, this mess of irregulars can register directly with the register of scammers. After many phone calls, promises and apologies, this party does not keep what they promise. It is up to the customer, to another company, but it is completely lacking in any form of self-reflection. NEVER GO INTO THE SEA!!!!!

",,
1199,2701," I tried to schedule a more precise time slot than a whole day. Zero cooperation was provided and I was casually informed that I should not have placed an online order, but had to ensure that I could pick it up myself. NB: I pay for this delivery because self-collection is not possible in terms of package size

",,
1200,2702," Very very very very very very unprofessional company. Moves the delivery time block 2 times a day, and eventually just doesn't show up. Radio silence, no call or message. Finally waited from 07.00 to 19.45 and also took it off from work without anyone stopping by.

Not even worth 1 star. I really don't understand why organizations like Maxaro do business with these amateurish transport companies that simply don't deliver. You don't have them any worse.

1201,2703," Received my order from Hornbach today. Supplied by van Spreuwel.
I read a lot of negative reviews, hence this positive one.
A nice lady contacted me about the delivery. After consultation, the delivery came on my day off.
I received an email about the time within which the delivery would take place.
The time was right, the place was right, the driver was nice friendly and cooperative.
I would order again and have Van Spreuwel deliver.
Good business. Highly recommended.

1204,2706," Customer friendliness is an unknown concept here. Worthless delivery of our goods from the Hornbach. No conversation to have.

",,
1205,2707," I read a lot of negative reviews about Van Spreuwel Transport here. In the past three weeks (Sept 2021) they have made two deliveries to me. Fast, easily accessible to make good delivery agreements that are also met, friendly and helpful employees and objects delivered without damage. Maybe I was lucky. Or maybe only the negative experiences are shared...

",,
1206,2708," Several crates were delivered today. Delivery man was very neat and polite. There was also no damage to the product. Just a pity that it was delivered during the Christmas holidays at half past eight in the morning.

",,
1207,2709," Very fast and correct delivery, even after an error on my part regarding the delivery address, very good customer service and communication and smooth delivery the next day!

",,
1208,2710," Contrary to all the negative reviews here, I had a great experience with van Spreuwel. Two orders from the Hornbach were delivered on time. At the first delivery I was not home yet and called the driver about where to put it. The drivers were very neat and friendly for both deliveries. So that deserves a positive review :-)

",,
1209,2711," The bank would be delivered between 1:30 and 4:30 in a new (and still vacant) house. Then the driver is there two hours earlier, and literally calls 1 minute! in advance to '' indicate this ''. I was half an hour away from the house at the time, as there are other items to be picked up for the move. The driver therefore asks whether he can leave the shipment in the hall. I agree that this should be allowed, provided that the responsibility for damage or theft can be recovered from the carrier. The driver indicates that it is their responsibility and that I do not have to pay for any unexpected costs for damage or theft. The whole conversation he was extremely annoyed and rude and during the conversation he suddenly hung up in my ear.

Shortly afterwards I received a call from the bank's company because they had been called by the driver. Here I explain the situation and it turns out that the driver is lying very hard! He said fifteen minutes before liver to have called me that he will be there earlier, while this was a minute in advance. It also appears that the costs of damage or theft are my responsibility! So if I had agreed with his idea, there was the chance that I would end up with a broken or no bank and could not get a new bank or money back! In the end I was able to arrange a new delivery with the store. But Spreuwel's driver was extremely rude and lies too. If I could give 0 stars I would certainly have done this.

",,
1210,2712," You will receive a message that they will deliver between time X and time Y. Then, halfway through that time, a call will be made that the delivery is not in the truck, but not to myself. I ring the bell afterwards and then they say ""Yes we have no order, so we cannot send anything"" .. Apparently they picked it up at the Hornbach on January 22, so they have 2 weeks to arrange it, but apparently that very difficult.

I read this in several reviews, that deliveries are ""lost"" or not put in trucks. Perhaps it is time for the company to see if they can get their logistics in order, because I have never seen such a bad number of stars at a transport company.

",,
1211,2713," Received an email message via Sanitairkamer on 16-6 that I could schedule my delivery date at Van Spreuwel

Delivery scheduled for 22-6 and the sanitary room indicated that I received an email with track & trace a day in advance around 10 p.m.

This eventually became at 23.30 and at that time the planning was not yet clear. Then the next day before 07:00 and it turned out that it came between 10:00 and 13:00.

Contacted van Spreuwel and indicated that I would like to be called 40min in advance so that I could be present in time for the delivery.

At 11 am I was called by Nick (driver) and indicated that he would be there within 5 minutes, unfortunately a miscommunication and Nick remained neat and professional and went to solve it with the planning. After this I was called by the planning and here too they remained neat and professional that Nick would first do another delivery and then visit me.

Nick has neatly delivered my things, explained that Spreuwel's partners (including Sanitairkamer) can still make a booking until 9 p.m. and therefore the planning is sometimes visible later than expected.

A very neat driver and very service oriented.

1212,2714," Hornbach order -
Nice delivery person and called ahead of time. That was great.
Only part of the order was missing. The lost part was marked online as delivered to de hornbach (via van Spreuwel) and van Spreuwel unfortunately couldn't help me with the undelivered part. The part that was not delivered was stated on the consignment note supplied.
Because van Spreuwel was unable or unwilling to help me, I contacted the Hornbach, who went looking for the lost products.
Unfortunately it has not been found and has to be sent again from the hornbach.

Three stars because the delivery person was nice and tidy, but the company did not want/could not help me with the lost products. An email with the track and trace was also missing. Tip for everyone who reads this, you can also check that on the website of Van Spreuwel itself. All in all not bad, just not very functional.

Edit: It took a long time before van Spreuwel or Hornbach found/delivered my order.

",,
1213,2715," First put off by the bad reviews, very unfairly. Contacted by phone the day before delivery, next day delivery with exact tracking of how many stops there are for delivery. So my experience is worth 5 stars.

",,
1214,2716," They deliver up to the first threshold. So if you live in an apartment complex, know that you can also bring your 50 kg heavy package with glass inside yourself. So even if you are working at home alone, are pregnant, are disabled in a wheelchair, or an 80-year-old man or woman without assistance. There are carriers that do deliver to the front door, and even inside as long as you keep your distance.
I had the delivery person take our shower cabin again. He didn't even have a cart to drive it to a door. So you don't want to take that risk

",,
1215,2717," Van Spreuwel Transport may not be the right partner for private deliveries for the Hornbach. The delivery did not come within the agreed time slot, there was no call in advance and the customer service was not available. When I indicated that I would be at the location within 5 minutes, it was indicated that it would be ""put in a parking space"". Once there I asked if it could be put in front of the door, but the driver didn't want that and he just drove off without me being able to check if everything was okay. Drywall is damaged and the order is not complete. For a hundred euros (!!!) delivery costs, it seems to me that more service should be provided.

",,
1216,2718," Had super friendly Mich at my door tonight in Rotterdam. I hadn't paid attention myself so I didn't open the first time, he came by especially at the end of the day 👍🏼👍🏼

",,
1218,2720," I have never seen such poor delivery service. The delivery man didn't even ring my doorbell while I was there waiting for my package. He just sent the information that I was not at home. 3 days after this pseudo delivery attempt I am still waiting for my package to be delivered to me. It's really shameful!

",,
1219,2721," The driver has neatly put the delivered items in the storage room. Only because of this a hole in the box is not seen. Opened the box to see if the toilet bowl was broken, but it wasn't. Didn't check whether the other content was okay. After two weeks of unpacking everything, it turns out that there is also a hole in the other box and right through the lid of the toilet seat. This as reported but received no cooperation because I was too late to report. Theoretically that is correct, but a little leniency……? Not so!

",,
1220,2722," If you read most of the reviews here it is almost all worthless at this company but it is human nature to usually write a review when it is not good.

That is why there are so many negative reviews and only a few positive ones.

Anyone reading this should consider that a logistics company completes so many more orders satisfactorily that there is nothing to read about.

If everyone would write a review, the overall picture would go up a lot!

",,
1221,2723," I don't normally post a review about a company quickly, but given the bad reviews from others, I may now need to. Van Spreuwel has now delivered 3 times for the Hornbach and those were really large orders (450 plasterboards, among others). Emailed last Monday to ask if they could deliver later due to bad weather forecasts this week. Half an hour later I received an email that I would be called to make an appointment. I already thought that was great. Then on Tuesday we called and the order could be delivered on Friday on request, while she actually wanted to deliver on Wednesday. Very friendly driver who neatly put all the pallets where I wanted.

Maybe people expect everything to be brought in for them, but that is normally not realistic, let alone in this corona time.

In summary: great company and I suspect that most of the negative reviews are from people who have too high an expectation pattern and are not sure what is meant by transport.

",,
1222,2724," To start positively: The order was delivered on time.

But the way of delivery was extremely customer unfriendly.
The order had to be delivered to a gallery flat on the 2nd floor.

It was a large, heavy package consisting of several boxes on a pallet. Boxes were damaged and torn, so they were not handled gently during transport.

Under the guise of Covid, the pallet is dumped outside on the street, while it would literally take 1 minute extra for the driver to unload everything on the 2nd floor right next to the lift (I really don't ask to deliver in house during Covid ).
This has nothing to do with additional contamination risk, but is simply a cheap excuse to dump stuff. It costs me a lot of work to move everything by hand myself and also to dispose of a pallet while the transport company can reuse it itself.

Really bad this.

",,
1223,2725," Our son's laminate floor was delivered to the transport company. We would get the time the night before around 9.30 pm what time they would deliver.
In the evening at 23.15 I received an email that they would deliver in the morning between 6.15 and 10.15.
The driver was also not very friendly.

1224,2726," Annoying company. They deliver heavy items to an apartment not on the right floor, even if there is an elevator. They hide behind corona and the conditions. But such a thing is no longer of this time. My 78-year-old mother had to solve it. Scandalous.

1225,2727," Send an email with a delivery time between 10.00 and 13.00. At 2 p.m. neatly called and then the delivery appears to come between 4 and 6 p.m. via a courier sent by them. If you then ask for it to come on another day, I have to pay extra.

for the third time it goes wrong!

1st time:
an email at 23:30 at night, tomorrow we will bring your package, when I read the mail I had been at work for a long time, I was called by the driver who was very rude, downright angry with me that I was not at home used to be...

2nd time:
received an email that they will deliver the next day between 07:00 and 19:00. after a whole day of waiting at home I left the house for a while.
finally at 7:15 pm a very angry driver on the phone that I was not home. well sorry.

then they wanted me to pay for the costs for a new delivery.

finally had the delivery a week later,
incomplete!! completely hopeless. am going to pick up the missing part myself, imagine having to do business with them again.

3rd time: (charm uhu)
had an email, we will come tomorrow between 12:00 and 15:00 well, would they have learned something?
I get a call at 11:30, we have lost your package, it is not included ..... so far no answer where my things have gone or when I get them.

the most hopeless company ever!

1230,2732," What a bad company. Ordered laminate through Kwantum. Upon delivery, the laminate is simply placed in front of the door and they were gone. Totally not professional. You're not paying for this anyway. What if it was raining or would be taken by someone else? And so it appears during laying that pieces are missing. So another 2 weeks waiting for a new appointment. Totally not recommended!

1231,2733," We also received our Hornbach order of 2500+ kilos delivered by van Spreuwel Transport. The evening before the delivery I started reading some reviews about this company, it could not but go wrong, or so it seemed from the reviews. We live on a busy road and have a very steep and narrow driveway. Now, a few moments after the delivery, I can tell you that this enthusiastic driver unloaded our order neatly and on time and was able to drive into the garage with his forklift and pump truck! Truly fantastic. Hope there are other people who share their positive experiences as well.

1233,2735," Last week I received an order through this transport company that I had placed with Kwantum. It was a few small boxes with blinds that were made to measure. The packaging read ""very fragile"" with COW LETTERS. Yet this transporter managed to deliver one of the packages damaged, with the result that the blind was also damaged. Incredibly bad considering the fact that I had to pay no less than 40 EURO delivery costs for this order! Then you can expect at least super service and that such a transporter handles goods at least carefully. Not so! When contacting this company to express my dissatisfaction with this matter, the situation was handled with a simple standard email. I do not advise anyone to do business with this company! They charge way too high and the service is horribly bad!

Week after Tuesday packages 3/5 brought sticker also 02-04 according to quantum everything was picked up on 02-04, which also appears from stickers but unprofessional drivers who load car with half of the collis and unload it just next to the car and find out . Week later after several phone calls suddenly tabletop bound packages 1/5 with sticker also 02-04 delivered with damage to box and tabletop due to the so-called being lost (just throw out of the bus in a corner or something) so now week later finally 5/5 packages delivered in 3x and therefore the table top is damaged.

1241,2743," Delivery for the Hornbach via Van Spreuwel. No communication. Delivery date agreed, nothing delivered. Ordered products are 'lost' or are not in the truck. One excuse after another. Hornbach is no better in this area, he says it is now with the transport company. I have incurred additional costs of €480 while we wait for the products. No response! And they are closed at 4:30 so cannot be reached after that (as indicated above)! WORTHLESS.

",,
1242,2744," I placed an order with Hornbach. There also paid freight costs. Delivery would take place via Van Spreuwel. Today I got a call asking if I'm home tomorrow. I will only be home for half a day tomorrow because I am bound by other other arrangements. Asked if I can arrange a different time and time slot. This is only possible for a fee. I find it very special that you have to pay costs twice for a normal shipment because Van Spreuwel is apparently unable to work in a customer-oriented manner. I refused to arrange a time slot for a fee. They concluded that delivery should then be canceled. If your transport needs to get a little worse, go ahead with this party! It is outrageous that Honrbach has partnered with such a party.

",,
1243,2745," Worthless!! Thrown off hold after waiting half an hour. Big mouth of the operators. Literally promised four times when it would be delivered. None of this complied with. Until now still waiting for a batch of plasterboard / cls beams. The entire renovation is now on hold. Never again for us hornbach, and especially van spreuwel is a company with which you should not do business.

HORNBACH THANK YOU!

",,
1244,2746," Worthless. Hardly any words for it. My parcel (80 kilos!) Was literally put on the street. The sidewalk was too high for them. Eventually having to call a friend to take the package off the street together. Driver said 'that's how we do it' and just drove away. Called customer service and passed the number plate, but they did not think it necessary to take action. I would strongly advise against all entrepreneurs to choose this party for delivery.

Send an e-mail at 10 pm that they will deliver something the next morning.

The 'customer service' emails with a no-reply address, there is no further contact information in the mail. So responding is not possible.

So customer service is NOT

The driver was very unfriendly. Left a bad rear taste about the company.

Overall a great experience!

1256,2758," To use the words of the driver ""service is only available in tennis"".
Scandalous behavior by the driver. The pallet was 1 cm wider than the raised edge of the path in the front garden. This was reason for the driver to indicate that he would leave it there on the sidewalk. Was unwilling to lift, touch, or take it off the pallet. I then did this myself to return the pallet to mister, he did this reluctantly.
As icing on the cake, no thank you, hello, good day or any other greeting at all. Trend of the words of mister were “I won't do that”, “I don't want to” and “no”.

1257,2759," Received a time slot by e-mail the day before, a friendly driver was at the door within these frameworks. On request, he drove his truck to the back and placed the pallet tiles (with due observance of the RIVM guidelines) in the requested place. Thanks for delivering!

1260,2762," Kind of slapstick.

Would come to deliver something (ordered online). Man with truck arrives, calls and says 'I can not find your order, I'll go back, search, can it be tomorrow?'. Then called with the message 'we will bring it tomorrow' and then called 'no, not because we have lost it'. Still received some confused telephone calls. Then silence.

Called later supplier, I, to ask 'is something happening?'. He said 'well actually not because the carrier has lost the item and we can not make a new order for the time being - no longer in stock'.

Order canceled, to prevent even more confused and pointless communication. What a prutsers. No apologies or anything. Gekluns.

",,
1261,2763," 2 times a delivery from van Spreuwel. The first delivery was a friendly young man who thought along and was helpful. The second delivery was done by an older man and that experience was a lot less. He looks rushed, is not helpful at all. Drive like a g * k with his pallet truck, with a bath of lots of money on it. He then puts it in front of the carport and figured it out under the guise ""I am not allowed to lift anything and I will not put anything inside, I will put it here"". If they deal with expensive items like that, then if I were Maxaro I would work with another transport company that would handle your products with care. He was also very short in the cart, which is why I give 3 stars, because the first young man was good at his job.

1262,2764," What a dredger !! Pay 45 euros to Hornbach for a delivery, cannot indicate or change the delivery date and only get the delivery time the day before at 11:00 pm ??? Most people have a job and have to arrange something. You don't get that chance here, just figure it out!
The boy who came to deliver the delivery did his job well and was very friendly, he can't help it.

Normally do not write a review that quickly, but was skeptical about the delivery (due to the bad google reviews) while that has turned out to be absolutely unnecessary

He had a very hard time getting near the restaurant (car-free zone) and had to search and wait for a long time until we could send someone to him. He remained super patient, even though he lost a lot of time because of us and was able to deliver in the end. I have not yet checked the order, but I would like to thank this driver very much!

Made a large order last week at hornbach. The site indicated that delivery would take place yesterday or today.
Called at 2pm this afternoon. An unfriendly man said I would be called back the same afternoon. He didn't want to help me now. So this has not happened anymore. Taken tomorrow to get started. Unfortunately not. If they had spoken to me properly now I would be at peace with it. But this...

1281,2783," Van Spreuwel Transport, if your transport needs to be slightly better.
Well, if your transport needs to be slightly worse, go with this party.

What a bunch of unprofessional prutsers.
If I could give 0 stars, I would have done this.

In addition to the fact that they have lost an order of 3 pallets (how is that possible?) You are also treated as coarse dirt.
With the umpteenth cancellation of the delivery due to a car accident, we called this 'company'.

It can happen that you are treated badly, sometimes you are even treated rude, and then you have Peter Werther's approach. The pinnacle of antisocial behavior that does not yet take the trouble to find a solution with you, calls you rotten fish on the phone, laughs at you and then throws the phone down. What a service. Peter class!

If you seriously want something 'transported', work with a professional party and go around Van Spreuwel with a big bow.

Subsequently, materials that were delivered incorrectly (Hornbach's mistake) would be exchanged. A special day spent at home for this. An hour before the delivery time a phone call that it would be a day later. No problem. However, it is clearly stated that no one is home and that they can simply exchange the materials that I have prepared. The next day they were alone leaving a note that nobody was home (?!) And a new appointment must be made. Nothing was exchanged while it was visibly ready.

Dear Spreuwel employees: If you want to keep satisfied customers, communicate with each other and keep your agreements!

On the day (a Friday) I received an email with the time that I could expect the driver. The positive also stops there. No driver seen. On Monday morning early, a driver was unexpectedly waiting at the door. Fortunately I was at home. What turned out to be half of the shipment. Had contact with the office, would be sorted out. That part turned out to be ""gone"", but was right again. New appointment scheduled for today (Tuesday) between 8 and 14. Meanwhile, just after half past one and no driver yet. And I'm on hot coals, because I have to go to work that way. This is not nice to say the least!

Me: ""Well, sir, I am working and will be there in 20 minutes at the earliest."" No sooner said than done. And I waited until five o'clock, but no one came. Then called customer service, they couldn't do anything for me, and I was not allowed to speak to a manager.

Approx. 2.5 weeks ago ordered a connecting door via Karwei and calls would be made for a delivery appointment. To my surprise, I received an email on Tuesday evening at 9:40 PM saying that the door will be delivered the next day. Wednesday morning called right away and explained the story, I work full time so delivering the door on that day was NOT. The appointment would be moved to today (Friday) and Thursday evening I would receive an email with a time indication. Seemed well agreed upon, great! But then a few hours later I am called by the driver that he is there in about 30 minutes. Too bad and sorry, but no one is home and the appointment has been moved to Friday. Driver was also not difficult, but unfortunately ... so far I still have not received an email from them with a time indication and by phone they are currently just really IMPROVED poor to unreachable. I wonder how long I have to wait for the door and whether it will be delivered at all.

Hornbach knows nothing about it, and DPD never received the package.
More than a week later, yes I understand the snow Yes I understand the Corona (therefore also online shopping)
But what I do not understand is that from Tuesday I am in possession of a track & trace that does not work but gives an error message.
DPD cannot be blamed for it is really again Spreuwel who is already missing the point.
If the Hornbach had wanted to send with DPD, they would have done that themselves on Monday!

It is well known that people are more likely to post when it is negative than when it is positive (the positive is taken for granted). Well: my experience with Van Spreeuwel: I received a message from Hornbach. they would deliver on March 13 / 14th. However, the 14th would be broken into the street with us, so delivery would not be possible !! called on 8 March with van Spreuwel and reported this. 'no problem! the order has been received. when does it work? TOMORROW?' Indicated, very much like tomorrow (so today, the 9th). It was supposed to be in the morning. Well, this morning around 8 o'clock, Starling was at the door and everything was neatly unloaded !!!

Special, because he should have actually already been at the door, so near my house would have had bad luck (of course, but it's special). A few days later a new block time was started without consultation, I was taken off again but this time no one came! No message, no information, nothing! It is incomprehensible that companies allow such transporters to drive for them, this company no longer meets what you can expect today.

1317,2819," Too bad I have to give at least 1 star because even that is not worthy of this company. Van sparuwel expects that people will not work in 2016 and will be at home all day.

I hear that my package has been sent back to the supplier! When asked why she didn't tell me that when I made the delivery appointment, I got the response, system error ma'am. This weekend I'm going to drive 260km to the supplier to pick up my package myself, which is less serious than having to do with mud.

Too bad you can not give this company a negative star 👎🏻

Unprecedented, delivery would take place today (Friday) between 07:00 - 17:00. No delivery yet at 4:30 PM. Called that tent, answered with difficulty (apparently it's already the weekend for them).

You will then stay in and around the house for a whole day. Lick my cardigan service.

What seems! The confirmation of delivery on September 15 was not true at all, even though the email really came from info@vanspreuweltransport. Well, then we will no longer deliver and certainly not during the weekend to solve the problem ...... Nahh .... for 1500 euros bathroom stuff while they start with the bathroom on Monday, then pray that they deliver on Monday.

Once and never again, I will also report this to the Hornbach because from now on I will go to the Praxis or the Gammel.

(tight mess, drama in terms of parking etc etc) Telephone contact was fine and clear. Called in advance on the day of delivery that the load arrived at the previously agreed time. Absolutely great. But ... then they still send a gigantic truck to bring it over ... Drama for the driver, can understand that he was not happy about that. But was extremely skilled with his driving and got it done. Was also critical of what he delivered and also took pictures of the damage. Two plasterboards damaged, but that is easy to cut away. To the planners: pay attention to where the driver has to go, this was just great. Could have easily been done with a little smaller.

Big order at hornbach ... at least they try to think along with that, but not at van Spreuwel.
- NO option in days ... delivery only on Tuesday
- NO flexibility to think along with the customer .... I have to pay 100euro delivery costs. Which is still quite high. Can be difficult to freeze, but well organized, goes from spreading difficult again to delivery to the shed, while I have a driveway where large heavy vehicles can go, such as agricultural machines ....
- items would be delivered within 2/3 working days, could only deliver after 1 week ... hornbach had arranged it well ... from Spreuwel not
- the start of my new project is delayed by Spreuwel because I don't have the things now.
- unfriendly employees at Spreuwel who do not think along with the customer.

Eventually after many calls back and forth the order of 2500 euros but canceled, because this is really no service in 2018.

Now I have ordered the construction materials from Bouwmaat ... they can deliver all working days, above a certain amount NO delivery costs and when filling in you can choose the time period they will bring it. THAT'S ONLY SERVICE .....
On balance, I am now 200 euros cheaper than with the hornbach for the building materials. I ordered the electricity, etc. via another website .... also free delivery above a certain amount and within 2 working days ....
I no longer place orders with companies that work with vanSpreuwel transport ..... They could learn something from this .....

Hornbach has lost a good customer who bought thousands of euros last year and would still do the next three if they weren't working with van Spreuwel .....

1327,2829," It was too difficult to push me to the driver. Not to mention the telephone waiting time

",,
1328,2830," What a bad company, even 1 star is too much. Last night I was in touch about a package that would be delivered today. We have indicated that we are home until 9:00. They said the delivery would be delivered before 9am this morning. Well, you guessed it .... but called at 8.55 and told what had happened last night. Unfortunately, the driver could not be present within 5 minutes. The lady contacted the driver again and it was agreed that it would be delivered after 12 noon. We are called around 10.30 that it can no longer be delivered today because the driver is no longer in Alphen !! Very unfriendly staff, promise things that didn't happen in the end.

",,
1329,2831," Super friendly and neat driver. With the busy traffic in the Netherlands it is almost impossible to deliver within certain hours, but your driver did it! He didn't even want a cup of coffee, because he wanted to get to the next customer in time!

",,
1330,2832," Rude driver who leaves me with a heavy door downstairs in the hall of the flat. See how you get it up! Can't finish a boe or bah, the only thing that came out was ""signature"" and he was gone ..
Well I have a crunchy back but I finally managed to get the door on the 7th floor but what a bad service ..

",,
1331,2833," The webshop I ordered automatically opted for transport with van Spreuwel. When reading these reviews the must fell into my shoes. Fortunately, Van Spreuwel did exactly what was agreed with me. I received a mail for a delivery date. This neatly filled out. The night before it was delivered, I received a neat e-mail with the time frame in which they would arrive (08:02 - 11:02) and around 09:00 they were neatly at the door. The driver who helped me was friendly and I am obviously not the worst person to lend a hand. I can only describe excellent. Exactly as agreed and the goods were neatly transported.

",,
1332,2834," Despite the deal, nobody came. The courier arrived the next day, without using the doorbell he threw the advice, although I was at home. Agreed next appointment, but the courier arrived on a different day. Contact with the office is difficult. No respect for the customer's time and lack of professionalism.

",,
1333,2835," Min 1 star. Very very very bad experiences with this company. They also hire other transport companies themselves, after which everything runs smoothly.

The web store offers a delivery between a certain time frame, but it will be rotten care for Spreuwel. They do nothing with that.

Not once, but several times. Hence my complaint.

",,
1334,2836," Neatly called 15 min before time and delivered on time. Friendly driver

",,
1335,2837," I can only agree with the various negative reviews. We had an order that would be delivered by van Spreuwel. No one showed up at the agreed time. No phone call, no SMS, no mail - just nobody and no information of any kind. We also couldn't call anyone, because it was after office hours. In the end, the delivery was delivered a day later, but without any form of consultation. You would stay home for that.

",,
1336,2838," Never have it delivered by this company. After they have made a delivery appointment, they do not hesitate. If you call about this, the ladies will laugh at you too. Definitely not a professional company, you better get your stuff with a trailer.

",,
1337,2839," Never had a flawless delivery of the 10 orders. Always late/damaged or wrong address. Unfortunately

",,
1338,2840," Van Spreuwel brought me transport a few times. From contact with customer service to driver; here only rude people work.

",,
1339,2841," What a pussy driver say (am also a driver myself so know how it goes)
Tis friday sir does not want to go 5 meters further in the fire corridor because he does nothing extra or you are a dick
I was not at home myself, but someone else, but this company does not have to deliver anything to me here in sliedrecht
And then also have to be home all day and have a schedule that they come in the evening also the planning of this company gets a 1 from me

",,
1340,2842," Why is the customer promised, if the customer calls the carrier two days before the delivery, that they can check the time of delivery the day before the delivery (which is already much too late!) and there is nothing on the website , as promised.
You can call the carrier on the morning of the delivery!
I can't think of a reason why a company should make their schedule so late. We are living in 2016!!!!!!

",,
1341,2843," Very satisfied, very good service and the drivers are all very helpful, really a big 10. We see you again on Wednesday spanking greetings.

",,
1342,2844," After excellent telephone communication, our order was neatly delivered to us in the back garden by a very friendly and helpful driver

",,
1343,2845," Van Spreeuwel is absent for 2 weeks. Not possible to make an appointment despite multiple attempts. Last time they showed up very early Monday morning without informing them in advance. While I have repeatedly contacted. Have no problems with the drivers but the communication within this company is not even worth 1 star. I was forced to bring my PC away after 2 weeks.

",,
1344,2846," Contrary to most of the reviews below, my experience with this transport company is very good. The driver made a decent call and did his utmost to get the things delivered to me. We are in a new construction location and there are no paved roads yet. which may theoretically lead to transport companies turning right again. But not this time. driver walked along to look at the possibilities and jointly found a way to get close to home and the things neatly delivered.
Absolutely great. !

",,
1345,2847," Very friendly driver and excellent customer service. Just called to discuss the delivery, whereupon the customer service suggested to consult with the driver (call 15 minutes before arrival). Driver has lifted our roof box the last part over our forest road and delivered it neatly to the house!

",,
1346,2848," Super bad thing! Orders of both praxis and hornbach are supplied by this bad company. Do not contact you for delivery and if you then call, you will also get a terrible cheeky mouth and they will 'flicker' your things in your garden when you are not there.

",,
1347,2849," Already have something delivered twice via van Spreuwel, first time a huge early time block (between 7.00 and 10.00) but luckily nicely on time and called in advance.
The second time a very heavy table (85 kg), which had to be 4 high (with lift). Friendly delivery staff, 10 minutes in advance called that they were almost there. The table only just fit in the elevator, and together with my friend they brought the table all the way into the living room. Top!

",,
1348,2850," Nice company, they come within the specified time slot and the driver was very friendly friendly helpful.

",,
1349,2851," Last Thursday, floor order at the quantum would be 06-06-2017 delivered just before delivery, we received an email that they did not deliver it, we called why not we have it in stock tomorrow, then we will deliver it 07-06 -2017 we received another email that it will not be called again and again the same story out of stock customer service from quantum have immediately made a report and they would call the company how it can be waiting for a call now

",,
1350,2852," This company is unreachable, connection keeps disconnecting after 10 min of queue, delivery days late without notification.

",,
1351,2853," This is not normal. When delivering, just put the stuff in the garden and left.

This is really, really bad. See all other reviews ..

",,
1352,2854," Waited all afternoon for something to come in tomorrow, fine then they report it (not so).
Had all my doubts when I saw the review of this company and they were rightly so.
Bad thing.

",,
1353,2855," Thank you for your commitment to deliver the pallet on time. Because of this, exactly on time to load into our house with a crane. Class

",,
1354,2856," dramatic transportation company.
Ordered June 5 June 7 delivered by Hornbach.
Two emails that 14 June was delivered.
Nothing seen.
Called company oh it is still in the warehouse may 18 June delivery.
Why Hornbach - I paid 100 euros for transport costs.
Update

Ordered twice because of no choice Hornbach
This time everything went a lot better with the track and trace

",,
1355,2857," It became very late when it would be delivered. When that was finally known, the cargo arrived 2 hours late without notification. If I were Hornbach I would find another carrier. This is outdated. Obviously unfair commercial practice.

",,
1356,2858," Never received a package from Hornbach and could not be contacted in any way.

",,
1357,2859," After reading all those dramatic reviews, I had little faith in a good delivery. But I was very helpful when I passed on a changed phone number and the delivery person was also flexible when my wife just had to pick up the kids from school on delivery. Everything is neatly put in the garage. In short, as you would expect ..

",,
1358,2860," Top delivery and very customer-friendly driver.
A big 10 for this company.

",,
1359,2861," Spreuwel has provided very impersonal and brutal delivery. After discussion with my wife they eventually left all their stuff on the street (a few thousand euros) and left. Later it turned out that a part had not even been delivered, this has been in the warehouse for weeks.
Sanitary shop personally brought in the stuff from the street. Service Sanitary shop super! service Spreuwel falls seriously short. I hope that Sanitairwinkel will switch to another carrier. This company does not fit in well with their vision of quality.

",,
1360,2862," Nice driver, nice customer service, everything top! Recommended, nothing wrong with that! Had concrete mortar from Hornbach.

",,
1361,2863," ""We agree 100% on what we agree on."" A quote from their website. Strange, since after waiting more than 3 hours my agreed shipment was not delivered without any message whatsoever.
For Van Spreuwel, the simple task of transporting a package from A to B within the same city is too difficult.

Sentenced by Kwantum to the services of this incapable gang. Horribly bad experience.

",,
1362,2864," Very poor services to the customer: deliveries are only made on weekdays, during the day between 8:00 AM and 6:00 PM and no time can be agreed. Order from iBood that would be delivered by van Spreuwel, but no cooperation at all from van Spreuwel. There can only be called half an hour in advance and then I would just have to come home from work ....
I work full-time, so delivery during the day without a time choice in advance becomes very difficult.
So think carefully about this before choosing Van Spreuwel Transport and Logistics as your supplier.
Van Spreuwel in any case does not cooperate and is not friendly to the customer.

",,
1363,2865," This company is not even worthy of 1 star.
Comes without an appointment. Driver cannot read map and / or has no navigation.
Driver is 20 meters away and drive on. I don't get the report at home ....
5 days later no delivery. What a hopeless club of incompetent, uninterested employees.
Elsemiek from custumerservice has also given up, according to me. This lady is also not doing anything to solve the problem.
It is really incomprehensible that a party like hornbach does business with this transporter. ????????
Will be the last time that I order something via the hornbach webshop ..
Should provide convenience but takes 100x more time.

",,
1364,2866," Just received my garden tiles. Very friendly and helpful driver!

",,
1365,2867," Contrary to what I read here. The time was nicely arranged with me and the driver called in advance to indicate that he was coming.
The driver also found it no problem to drive a little extra with the forklift truck (due to dead end street).
In summary, I am very satisfied with the course of my delivery (order Hornbach).

",,
1366,2868," Top driver! Called in advance that it was coming !!! 2 minutes later he arrived! Super guy!

",,
1367,2869," Very friendly driver who was super helpful and neatly within the time slot. Worth a compliment.

",,
1368,2870," Twice the order was not delivered.

",,
1369,2871," What a bad transport company. Doors ordered from Praxis Will there be such an inbreeding driver from that transport company. Throw a pallet in front of the door and it is gone. What a drama company

",,
1370,2872," Very friendly driver and very helpful very top!

",,
1371,2873," Today I delivered an order to me in Kinrooi. Despite slight panic about the order, the driver remained patiently attentive and helpful. Big praise for him! Business card for the company!

",,
1372,2874," Respect for the driver of spat Rob van Zanten he is passionate about his work
In the evening hours a complete bathroom was delivered and that during carnival
And the Hornbach has only forgotten to give the shower cabin to him 😕

",,
1373,2875," Had a great experience with a good thinking driver!

",,
1374,2876," Friendly driver, he put my cupboard package neatly in my shed, because I can't lift, he was also on time! Top

",,
1375,2877," T&T codes are not applicable on the website. Very difficult to reach by phone.

",,
1376,2878," Praxis ordered a vanity unit.
Just don't get it at home because you can't get the spell out to agree on a delivery date.
This way I don't dare to order anything from Praxis anymore.

",,
1377,2879," The product (treadmill) was delivered to the front door of the apartment building (5 layers, 8 apartments).
They refused at all to (help) carry the packet inside and put it on the elevator. The driver (a tough lady) had never heard of friendly behavior. I had never experienced such an undecided behavior before, and the story of this woman ""we howv to deliver to the first door, of course, made no sense.
I will NEVER have anything delivered via van Spreuwel Transport.

",,
1378,2880," Clyde has just neatly delivered our delivery from Maxaro. Just good 👍

",,
1379,2881," A star is still too much. No appointment to make. In addition, still waiting for the subsequent delivery of broken material. Renting and driving yourself is a lot better.

",,
1380,2882," Too bad about the antisocial truck drivers who make the roads unsafe. These drivers must be retested if they are to be repressive.
Do not allow anything to be transported by this company, because apart from the fact that they employ antisocial pleuris drivers, they do not know that they are on time.

",,
1381,2883," What a bad company. If you get a schedule (for the 2nd time) they call off again that they are not coming .... What a bad planning and service.

",,
1382,2884," 2 pallets of floors have been delivered at the door. It was agreed with Kwantum in advance that it would be set in motion. Appointment was not fulfilled. Delivery driver did not want to cooperate.

EDIT: adjusted to 3 stars. Deliverers have been approached and v Spreeuwel Transport has refunded the delivery costs as compensation.

",,
1383,2885," Rude driver. Unhelpful. Lack of communication skills. Hopefully never anything will be delivered to me by this company.

",,
1384,2886," Today in the morning I received a shipment of the quantum around 8 o'clock, the 2 boys who delivered the 2 box springs, the headboard and a 2 person mattress took it to the second floor and then also up the stairs again to the bedroom without being asked.
I had read a lot of bad reviews in advance but I can't say otherwise that the service from the 2 guys was really top.
They were in car number 429 on 06-03-2018 around 8 o'clock in Maarssen and they provided siper service I can't say anything else.
Delivery drivers should be more frequent.

",,
1385,2887," Just received a delivery, delivery guy was besides friendly, very helpful and professional. Nothing to complain about!

",,
1386,2888," what a bad and unprofessional company. Do not have the administration in order yourself and still bother the customer with it. Service is hard to find with this company.

",,
1387,2889," Delivery neatly on time. And have nothing but compliments to the driver for thinking about placement.

",,
1388,2890," My purchase at Sanitairwinkel (Belgium) came with Van Spreuwel Transport: bath, shower tray, faucet.
After reading bad reviews on the internet I already held my heart, but everything was delivered correctly. At 6am I received an email with an estimate of the hour of delivery (9am - 12pm). Everything was delivered correctly within that period and on time. My purchase was driven on a large pallet in the entrance hall. All items were intact.

1404,2906," Today they supplied a washing machine. And when she lifted it up, a scent of air hung. The boys themselves realized this too, but just check it out, no! Then the entire staircase, first and second floor under the poop tracks. They couldn't do anything about it, called the company and got the same statement. What a BAD SERVICE !!

1463,3061," At Schavemaker Transport BV in Breda two Polish drivers with iron bars were beaten this morning by security guards hired by the management.

The Polish part of SchavemakerTransport, Schavemaker Poland, has been on strike since Friday for a better wage. They receive 700 euros per month, regardless of the number of overtime hours. Other drivers from Schavemaker Poland are on strike in Spain, France, Poland and the Netherlands.
 
Nine Polish drivers in Breda had been locked up on the Schavemaker site since Friday in the cabin of their truck, so that it could not be driven away by others. The management of Schavemaker has hired a Ukrainian security company to put an end to the strike. These â € œprotectorsâ € broke into a side window of one of the lorries and forced the Polish driver out of his cab. A second driver was also abused, after which the remaining strikers intimidatedly left their car.

Reinier Stroo
 
FNV Bondgenoten director: â € œItâ € ™ s crazy for words. Firstly, you resolve a dispute through consultation. And if that doesn't work, you call the police. You're not going to hire a security company to solve your problems? Secondly, I think the strike is justified, the wage is much too low. A good development that the Polish employees realize that they do not have to work for a hunger wage.â €   

One of the two Polish drivers was transported by ambulance. The second is treated on the spot for, presumably, a broken nose. The four security guards were arrested by the police and the director, Henk Schavemaker, was taken to the office for questioning. Trade union official Stroo also issued a statement to the police of what he found.

",,
1770,3820," Two hours of waiting in front of the office is almost the same amount under the ramp, taking into account that my car and several trailers are standing at 25 ramps. Only promise in a couple of minutes we will start downloading. Terrible .... I went to register for the third time to clarify when they would start loading me, so in response to me they raised their voice and drove me into the car. This is my worst download in the Netherlands 👎👎👎👎👎👎

Arrived at 07.00, told to wait 30 minutes, ok, came at 07.30, wait again until 08.00. ok, there is no ref number, I went to find out - not the one, ok, came again - then they started shouting and kicking me out of the office instead of understanding the situation. He who sits in the office is rude and does not know how to work with staff, complains to all his colleagues and pokes his finger at the driver, as for me it is unethical, does not know the rules of etiquette. The worst unloading in the Netherlands, although the country is good.

",,
1775,3825," Good heavens what an aso of a driver who came here in the street to deliver something. Parked in front of our driveway (okay no problem), however after Mr. finished loading he remained parked in front of our driveway and we had an appointment, so we had to leave. We waved at the driver first, no response. Then a knock on his door, no response. Finally we went NEXT to his door but mister refused to move. All he had to do was drive 2 meters back and we could have left but no ... imagine ... Not even 10 seconds after we left, mister just left so I have the feeling that he also did on purpose. What a childish, hopeless K * T driver..bah yuck ...

1892,4162,IT IS SHOCKING HOW BAD Customs Clearence Team Leader Nicole is dragged some random file request for 3 days. I called Osborn Customs Services Ltd after I had enough of TWILL. And they sorted the issue out in 1 HOUR. 1 HOUR!!!! TWILL CUSTOMS CLEARENCE TEAM HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING.,,
1893,4163,The best digital freight forwarder on the market! You can make a booking within 30s. So exceptional. Thank you guys.,,
1894,4164,Great place to work 😀,,
1895,4165,No space...always,,
1896,4166," No telephone support. The phones are turned off.

There is a lot of error with bookings, because communication with TWILL is not possible, the problems escalate.

2nd booking we try through them, and 2 times complete chaos.

Twill is a subsidiary of Maersk, you would expect Maersk to at least assist with TWILL bookings. I just called Maersk Netherlands and the support people don't even know Twill.

My container has already been transferred to 3 ships this time. At a later date. There is no information.

And those are the so-called ""two way committent"" bookings, where TWILL / MAERSK guarantee the booking. They clearly overbook their ships, and TWILL's bookings are apparently very low in priority at MAERSK.

During the move they knew what they were doing. They arrived on time, packed and unpacked everything with care, were very organized and professional, provided good suggestions and listened to my special requests. The move was smooth because they had prepared well and they were flexible - when the bed was too big for the stairs they lifted it over the balcony. And the best part - they were so pleasant, helpful and friendly that it made a big move happy instead of stressful. I have moved 7 times across 3 countries in the past 10 years and this was the best moving experience I have had. I highly recommend EA Logistics.

Idem Location Malaga same top service. Ron is easily accessible, very helpful and involved. With regard to the last one I had handed in my motorcycle for transport to the Netherlands Ron gave me a lift to the airport AND asked if I had my house keys with me. THANKS Ron for this involvement, she had left it in the tank bag on my motorcycle 🙈.

For both locations it also applies that if your stuff does not fit on your motorcycle crate, they will add an extra pallet or box, at no extra cost.

In short, there is no reason not to have your motorcycle transported to Spain via Nord Cargo, you will not regret it,

And already when I hung up the seal there was no way to re-count the pallets. And so everything is ok. Coffee in the office in the vending machine is free. You drive up to the gate, the office is on the left. There you show the ref and take the documents.

2049,4470," They artificially drag out time in the office.

Without a ref number, it is impossible to load or unload, but when they take the papers, they will not ask about the ref number. As a result, we will lose 20 minutes in vain.

Then you wait at the reception for your papers and there is an opportunity for another cup of coffee and possibly a sheet to read. Again, I don't find anything wrong with this company 👍👍

2100,4585," Do not hire this company. Driving times are not respected. They always force you to schedule and say that Bemotrans is responsible for any fine. Breaks are not respected. The Bemotrans employees sitting at the office have tachograph cards and oblige the drivers to drive further with their cards. I am attaching an example (picture) of how I have received this card numerous times. It is a law at Bemotrans that each driver has two tachograph cards. He forces you and doesn't give you the money he promises. Deer. Dear colleagues, avoid this company because it also has Romanian puppies who, in turn, use several cards.

2184,4798," Today (25-5-2022) Mister drove from Zwolle to Amersfoort. It was around 3:30 pm and already busier than usual on the road.

Of course it is 100 kmh during the day in the Netherlands, but I'm guessing that 1 of the drivers or the boss himself is not aware of the current regulations.

Each held back because of the crowds and drove between 100 to 110 km / h. When I decided to overtake a truck with the permitted 100 kmh, a van was almost pressed against my bumper. In the end, this turned out not to be voluntary because Mr. ''BVW Logistics BV'' had just not come into contact with the rear license plate of that bus. After the bus went off and I overtook the truck, he decided to stick me too.

After I was able to make room he pushed a little extra which shows how inexperienced and amateur drivers this company has.

He then drove off antisocially and also caused dangerous cases. I advise Mr. to take driving lessons and these kind of company vans prove that many people no longer have the ability to empathize. As a company with a logo on the vehicle, I also advise you to immediately adjust driving behavior for your own advertising, since I and many third parties do not want to work with such a company.

",,
2237,4936," We used the motorcycle transport to Italy. Very satisfied with it! An absolute must in all respects. Due to circumstances, one person did not go last minute, so that motorcycle transport was not necessary either. This was refunded without hesitation. We will certainly continue to rely on their transport and service in the future. For those who are still in doubt... DON'T doubt just DO IT!

2239,4938," Although I have personally never had a product transported by Van Dijk Logistics, I have been able to experience the organization inside and out for some years now.

Van Dijk is a real family business. Honest, sincere, pleasant to deal with and with a good dose of humor. The choice to opt for only transport to and from Italy and your own branch in Italy makes this a perfect partner for all your logistics issues between the Netherlands and Italy.

Bribes company doctors to deny all work-related illnesses. Comes close to torture (psychological) of employees who are overloaded. Mandatory total burnout employees to return to work within a week, refuses external burnout recovery processes, refuses decent second track with outplacement ..... everything partly partly due to Bezava's perverse effects.

Things are going reasonably well for the customer, but not for their own employees, which are business assets that are squeezed out as much as possible.

We checked the trailer, then to the bureau, where they wrote out documents for loading, called the ramp number and gave a seal. They load from the ramp quickly, the seal is hung immediately after loading near the ramp, then again at the bureau, they write out documents and leave. Friendly staff, everything is organized

2375,5268," When registering, you need a passport. Parking is for registration only, there is no place to pause.

I went to the office, gave the ref number back, they gave me the docks and said which ramp. I arrived at the ramp and stood for 5 hours while loading. But upon arrival under the ramp, you need to drive in to prepare it and be sure to put a counter rollback, otherwise they will not load. And we sit in the car and wait for the body to come out of the ramp and scream to carry the docks. Although there were other colleagues who, as someone, quickly unloaded someone slowly. The staff is fine, there is a toilet in the office, and a coffee machine (free coffee) good luck to everyone and quick pickups

This man, Achour Lali, has a wife and children. I saw it myself, I'm ashamed I didn't say anything. It's an open secret that this guy is only at work hitting on girls/women and trying to get them into bed. Because of this I had to see many colleagues go.

2598,5934," Various granules are put in place, collectibles. Loading is long, if you run out of time, you can untie it after an office consultation, the spare will be loaded. You can park in the surrounding streets, but after 20:00 you will be lucky to find a place.

",,
2601,5937," Everything is beautiful, cultural ...
I drove in, put under the ramp while waiting for the documents, drinking delicious coffee, for free🤣

",,
2602,5938," Everything went well, we entered the territory, there is a parking lot opposite the ramps to go to the registration. If they do not immediately put under the ramp, they give a pager and send them to the parking lot (on the territory behind the warehouse). The pager shows the number of the ramp, stood under the ramp, brought the pager. The download is not long. They downloaded it, to the office for documents. There is a toilet, tea and coffee.

",,
2603,5939," Terrible experience. I stop at the ramp to load around 17:00, loading lasts until 22:00, working hours ended at 20:00, they were not so understanding as to allow me to sleep in their parking lot (where there was space), they drove me out into the street. Catastrophe.

",,
2604,5940," Long loading from the ramp, about 2 hours, then everything is cool. Open car park 5-22 are open from 6.

2605,5941," Everything is easy. I drove into the territory, registration is on the left, called the ref-gave the ramp, drank coffee, closed the gate, took the documents and set off 🙂

Friendliness zero points.
There is a shortage of drivers, here you can see why!

2608,5944," Loading for fun. When it was clear that they would not load until the end of the performance, they let me stretch and start a break, in the morning it was loaded just to click, take the cmr and done .. Just parking on the street

",,
2609,5945," Driven on behalf of Nunner Austria, and outright disgrace, accept freight and then mention that you can only unload at the end of the day, unload the car then wait 2 hours for checking, and do not pay waiting hours. An absolutely worthless company. Don't drive for it

",,
2613,5949," After entering the company premises, you need to go to the parking lot behind the warehouse building. Because it gets confusing when you leave your car right after entering, the parking lot is marked. You can speak Polish, friendly service. There is coffee and a toilet in the waiting room.

",,
2614,5950," Poor company! Waiting 9 hours in the parking lot, another 2 hours on the ramp. There is only a toilet for drivers.

For 1 year: now you only have to wait 2 hours at the ramp and half an hour for the papers.

",,
2615,5951," Overall, not bad. We register at the bureau. We stand under the ramp. We are waiting. We leave for the parking lot and go to the office for documents. The office has a toilet and coffee. The wait depends on the influx of cars.

",,
2616,5952," Arrived at 04:50, got into their parking lot. The office is open, there is a toilet, coffee, tea for free. But they work from 06:00. They immediately gave me a frame. Downloaded at 09:00, received documents. 3 unloading. Only 13000 kg.

",,
2617,5953," Parking is available from 5 to 22. It took 1.5 hours to load. About 1/3 of the pot was stored. There was paperwork quickly. Of course there is no parking anywhere in the evening. (Europe truckers on Facebook)

",,
2618,5954," Solve appointment at 8 am. Immediately placed at the Dock and after 3 hours they finally start unloading which also takes 2 hours. Why do I have to unload at 8 !? Just let me know 11 hours if I am only unloaded after 3 hours.

Unfortunately, the employees of a good company bring its name down!

",,
2619,5955," On the territory of the company there is a parking lot where you can put your truck and go to the office. At registration it is obligatory to ref. number. The office has a toilet and a table with coffee (free) after registration you will either be told the ramp number or told to wait in the office or given a pager. Loading is carried out from a ramp, the load is not heavy, without lining, but it takes a long time to load .. after loading the CMR, they issue their own. Good luck to all

",,
2620,5956," It's nice... it has coffee available, bathroom, friendly staff.

",,
2621,5957," They ship quickly. There is a parking on the territory, only open from 5 to 22. You can spend the night along the road.

",,
2622,5958," Registration at 8-00! They gave me a pager, at 12-30 silence! There is a toilet and coffee! On the territory there is a parking from 5-00 to 22-00 you can stand! The staff is polite and friendly!

",,
2623,5959," Waiting for loading in the parking lot: 1 hour, under the ramp 4 hours. They load extremely slowly, when a car with a Dutch registration arrives, they stop loading you and load this car first of all. Extremely negative

",,
2624,5960," If you are a Pole or a Dutchman, then they will load quickly, the rest wait for 5-7 hours. Very, very bad address.

",,
2625,5961," Quick reloading, but sometimes 3 hours under the ramp, you can leave the semi-trailer under the ramp overnight, and take the documents in the morning from 7:00 onwards and leave

",,
2626,5962," It takes a long time to load at the office to submit ref for loading and the Dutch have priority, I stayed about 40 minutes to register. Very arrogant staff !!!!! In addition we had to wear a mask they did not.We stayed 4.5 hours on the ramp to load

",,
2627,5963," Nice personel. Free coffee for the drivers. Loading or unloading, could go faster but everything is still OK. Little parking space for trucks and a relatively small yard.

",,
2628,5964," Loading 30 minutes. The staff is polite. DEM after loading is given. Ramps. There is coffee, a toilet.

",,
2629,5965," Upon arrival, they put it on a ramp, immediately began to unload it and immediately loaded it. Tea and coffee as a gift. (freebie)

",,
2630,5966," I got the ramp very quickly. But it takes a long time to charge you

",,
2631,5967," A good company, but the loaders were recruited ""from God."" The Poles will supply everything, so it will fall. And if it doesn’t fall, then it will be pierced with a pitchfork.

",,
2632,5968," I went to the boot at 6:30 and left at 14:45, if you don't have much time to come here

",,
2633,5969," Quickly accept! But the wait is long.
There is parking, shower and toilet!

",,
2634,5970," 5 hours waiting for the download. Time is up. Left the trailer on the ramp, drove off to the parking lot. The trailer was picked up the next morning. There is a toilet and free coffee.

",,
2635,5971," Easily accessible, clearly indicated where you need to be as a driver, quickly helped at the counter, unloading also quickly, all right....

",,
2636,5972," Great company! All clear. Registration, under the ramp, to the parking lot, in 10 minutes for the documents.

",,
2637,5973," 8 hours of loading under the ramp speaks for itself. And it is not a coincidence that many drivers said that you can drive them off at loading.

",,
2638,5974," Helped well, was actually a day too early, but they released me anyway. Great nice company

",,
2639,5975," Failure 9 hours waiting for loading plus the only one that the toilet and a Pole in the office

",,
2640,5976," Tragedy. 6 hours from arrival to the end of unloading! Avoid a wide berth!

",,
2641,5977," Much time will wait to load.

",,
2642,5978," Unloading goes quickly, worse with loading. When they load, it turns out that they forgot to load something. Two Poles work in the warehouse.

",,
2643,5979," Loading about 1 hour. Very nice company

2644,5980," Long waiting for loading.
At the reception very nice Czech and Pole but can not do much as they do not have the goods yet .... good free coffee.

What a very large K * T company this is. In this corona time you will receive a message for the umpteenth time with we have missed you, while we are at home with the whole family. So it's only your turn after Easter. And hopefully they will come.
Just be honest and say because of the crowds we do not have time, but we have not missed you !! And from now on throw a ""not at home"" message through the mailbox, so that you can prove that one of your colleagues has been at the door !!
But no. Want to have a nice early weekend like every weekend and then throw everything at the spar without a single delivery attempt that is nice and easy!

I hope soon that there will be a delivery service in Dongen that can make it happen to deliver on time or that at least has the balls to be honest!

Call them again, say that your package is on its way again, while you did not know. Promise to contact the driver to deliver it to neighbors. Not delivered to neighbors. If you call them again, promise to call them back. Nothing more heard. No package. Do not deserve a star.

2742,6251," I made an appointment with them several times that they would deliver, nobody will show up. Now they say that the package is delivered, but that did not happen, they have a signature of someone at another address that does not exist and they do nothing about it because then they say they will sort it out and will call back, but that they don't.

2848,6513," On Friday May 8th I should have a kamado BBQ delivered to me. Unfortunately this has not happened. And that is of course very disappointing !!

A week in advance I get a message from the BBQ supplier that they are coming on May 8. In the same week a message from transporter Wesseling that they will deliver on May 8. Found out that the consignment has been outsourced to de Graaf.

I arranged everything for help (it's a heavy BBQ), day off (because the BBQ is delivered to the front door). And I don't have a front yard, so I have to bring the BBQ back right away. So I am fully prepared.

And nothing came. Finally called to the Count. It was true that the shipment had to be delivered on Friday, but something had gone wrong. Then you would think, they come up with a solution and bring it the next day, then I could have arranged everything. But no, probably Monday.

The annoying thing about this is that I as a customer have to call where my shipment will go. It would have been nice that you called. The annoying thing is that I can arrange everything for Monday when you come. And guess what !!

They are not coming today Monday 11 May !!! Unknown! The shipment was again not taken with a car due to an error. What a mess, bad service. Must call everywhere at the back, mail is not responded to. Can't say from transporter Wesseling, respond to everything and quickly.

Now agreed to come tomorrow, hopefully. I disagree, but there was no other way. Spoken and helped by lady on the phone.

2950,6832," A shipment would be delivered before my vacation, as promised by the foreign company. 2 days before the holiday I called and the company would go after it. It was supposed to be delivered before my vacation. So this didn't happen. Tuesday morning at my holiday address I got a call that the package would be delivered that day (ehhh). I believe that Mrs. had never received an answer that this was not possible, because it led to great bewilderment. If I couldn't let anyone run. She would have the driver come back and we made another appointment. But in the evening I had a voicemail from another southern employee that a driver had been at the door and no one was home. New. That could be right. When I wanted to get in touch again, because the return journey was delayed and the delivery had to be moved, the number was not answered. The foreign company then informed me that Schenker had indicated that he was difficult to reach by telephone due to crowds. He would arrange a day later.
I called the day in question, but my package was very difficult to find. In any case, he was not scheduled. So it was a day later. The driver would call 1 hour in advance at my request so that I could inform someone who had to drive half an hour to get to my address to receive the package. However, the driver called 15 minutes in advance. I had just come home, but I was late for work because of the joke. The friendly driver is the only 5 stars.

Everything is planned and promised, but agreements are not kept. After you make your complaint known by telephone, you will not be taken seriously and treated rudely! Pay attention and choose another transport company if possible file a complaint with your supplier that you do not accept goods if they are sent with a donor.

As multiple reviews written below, excuse after excuse to pay a bill. Average payment term is 90/100 days if you are lucky, and 120 in bad luck. Everywhere is an excuse for that. Tip and advice for people who want to do business with L4u is just look a little further, for the client as the supplier. Are sufficient other parties that do meet their agreements.

The actual weight of the cargo turned out to be more than 5 tons. We received a fine from the police, paid for the warehouse services, made an additional fright from the warehouse to the delivery place.
In total, our expenses amounted more than 900 euros.
Kennis refuse to pay us, they say that the driver should have realized himself that the car is overloaded ..
We are asking TimoCom for help in resolving this issue.

",,
3212,7551," Directions as it is navigating. We report to the office, we get a ramp. When it is free we drive up, when it is busy we wait until it becomes vacant. After reaching the ramp, we stand 2-3 meters from the ramp and stand with the door closed until a warehouse worker comes to us or calls us from the ramp to drive up. Unloading on the side of the company, the driver is waiting in the cabin. They immediately replace the pallets on the ramp. After all, we go to the office where we checked in and collect the signed papers.
When we are on time, everything goes quite smoothly.

",,
3213,7552," Worthless company. Long wait every time I come here. Today a total of 4 hours for 18 pallets. This is by far one of the worst companies to go to. Closing, aborting and starting over is the only option as far as I'm concerned.

",,
3215,7554," I warn all drivers who come here to either load or unload at once, this is a terrible warehouse. If you are immediately given a ramp and immediately picked up by a loader, then you are very lucky. The staff are terrible. I arrived an hour ahead of time, as a result, I defended myself with a pager at 2:45 a.m. and after another 3:00 h under the ramp, they unload slowly and they are in no hurry to do something. Those who do not have time do not come here because they simply will not take you on time. There is no parking just near the fence and then at your own peril and risk. You cannot stand on the territory. There is a shower and a toilet, but coffee is all to one place.

3220,7559," You have to wait for unloading and then unloading, however, I never unloaded myself, there was always an employee who helped. Behind the building behind the building, up the stairs is a toilet, a canteen and free tea from a vending machine. Parking is unfortunately not possible there.

The next day the car again did not come and this time the reason was given as 'company was closed'. Also completely bullshit.

On Friday, August 26 at 3.30 pm the blond driver with car V-535-JK appeared and told me that he was new in this area and therefore could not find it for the previous two days. When I asked him why he had given another reason for not delivering the order, he did not answer.

Today, Tuesday, September 6, another delivery would take place. And the same thing happened: nobody came to the door, I was present all day. And the reason 'company was closed'. No Firm Logistics car has been at our premises at all !!!

Calling the company didn't help, because after 10 rings the voicemail comes.
